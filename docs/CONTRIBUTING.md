## Create a virtual environment

```bash
python -m venv env
```

## Activate the virtual environment

> For windows

```bash
env\scripts\activate
```

> For Linux

```bash
source env/bin/activate

Now you are done with the project setup, now you can make the changes you want or assign.

### Let's say you want to scrape the avatar URL of a user. The steps to apply in order to achieve this are as follows:

- At first, we have to scrape the profile page of a user. For that, we have defined a function in the user class as

```python
# scrape-up/src/scrape_up/github/users.py

from scrape_up.config.request_config import RequestConfig, get

class Users:

    def __init__(self, username, *, config: RequestConfig = RequestConfig()):
        self.username = username
        self.config = config

    def __scrape_page(self):
        username = self.username
        data = get(f"https://github.com/{username}", self.config)
        soup = BeautifulSoup(data.text, "html.parser")
        return soup
```

- The `__scrape_page` is a private function defined to scrape any page.
- Now we have to create a function with an appropriate name, in this case, `followers`.
- `scrape_up.config.request_config` contains our custom get function. This function takes 2 parameters: `url` and `config`. The `url` parameter is the URL of the page you want to scrape. The `config` parameter is an instance of the `RequestConfig` class. The `RequestConfig` class contains various settings like headers, timeout, and redirect.

```python
def followers(self):
    page = self.__scrape_page()
    try:
        followers = page.find(class_ = "avatar avatar-user width-full border color-bg-default")
        return followers["src"]
    except:
        message = f"{self.username} not found !"
        return message
```

- When you do inspect the element of the page, you will get to know the class named `avatar avatar-user width-full border color-bg-default` contains the avatar URL.

Once you are done with the changes you wanted to add, follow the steps to make the pull request.

## Create and checkout to the new branch.

PowerShell
git checkout -b <branch_name>

## Add the changes

git add .

## Commit your change with a proper message

git commit -m "Enter your message here"

## Make the Pull Request

git push origin <branch_name>
