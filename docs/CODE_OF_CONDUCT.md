# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We, as members, contributors, and leaders, pledge to create a harassment-free experience for everyone in our community. We welcome individuals regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We commit to fostering an environment of empathy, kindness, diversity, inclusivity, and health.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment include:

- Demonstrating empathy and kindness towards others
- Respecting differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
- Giving and accepting constructive feedback gracefully
- Taking responsibility for our mistakes, apologizing to those affected, and learning from the experience
- Considering the well-being of the entire community, not just ourselves

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

- Use of sexualized language, imagery, or advances
- Trolling, insults, derogatory comments, personal attacks, or political attacks
- Harassment, whether public or private
- Publishing others' private information without explicit permission
- Any conduct that could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Community leaders are responsible for enforcing these standards and will take fair corrective action in response to inappropriate behavior. They have the right to remove, edit, or reject contributions that do not align with this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for their actions.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies to all community spaces and when individuals are officially representing the community in public. This includes using official e-mail addresses, posting via official social media accounts, or acting as appointed representatives at events.

## Enforcement

Report instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior to the community leaders responsible for enforcement at [contact email]. All complaints will be promptly and fairly reviewed and investigated.

Community leaders are required to respect the privacy and security of incident reporters.

## Enforcement Guidelines

Community leaders will use these guidelines to determine consequences for violations:

### 1. Correction

**Community Impact**: Use of inappropriate language or behavior deemed unprofessional or unwelcome.

**Consequence**: A private, written warning from community leaders, explaining the violation and why it was inappropriate. A public apology may be requested.

### 2. Warning

**Community Impact**: A violation through a single incident or series of actions.

**Consequence**: A warning with consequences for continued behavior. No interaction with the people involved for a specified period, including in community spaces and external channels. Violating this may lead to a temporary or permanent ban.

### 3. Temporary Ban

**Community Impact**: A serious violation of community standards.

**Consequence**: A temporary ban from any interaction or public communication with the community. No interaction with the people involved is allowed, including unsolicited contact. Violating this may lead to a permanent ban.

### 4. Permanent Ban

**Consequence**: A permanent ban from any public interaction within the community.
