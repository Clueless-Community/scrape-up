The use of creatine monohydrate (Cr) in professional soccer is widely 
documented. However, the effect of low doses of Cr on the physical performance 
of young soccer players is unknown. This study determined the effect of a low 
dose of orally administered Cr on muscle power after acute intra-session fatigue 
in young soccer players. Twenty-eight young soccer players (mean age = 17.1 ± 
0.9 years) were randomly assigned to either a Cr (n = 14, 0.3 g·kg-1·day-1 for 
14 days) or placebo group (n = 14), using a two-group matched, double-blind, 
placebo-controlled design. Before and after supplementation, participants 
performed 21 repetitions of 30 m (fatigue induction), and then, to measure 
muscle power, they performed four repetitions in half back squat (HBS) at 65% of 
1RM. Statistical analysis included a two-factor ANOVA (p ˂ 0.05). Bar velocity 
at HBS, time: p = 0.0006, ŋp2 = 0.22; group: p = 0.0431, ŋp2 = 0.12, time × 
group p = 0.0744, ŋp2 = 0.02. Power at HBS, time: p = 0.0006, ŋp2 = 0.12; group: 
p = 0.16, ŋp2 = 0.06, time × group: p = 0.17, ŋp2 = 0.009. At the end of the 
study, it was found that, after the induction of acute intra-session fatigue, a 
low dose of Cr administered orally increases muscle power in young soccer 
players.

Background Chorioamnionitis is a common antecedent of preterm birth and induces 
inflammation and oxidative stress in the fetal lungs. Reducing inflammation and 
oxidative stress in the fetal lungs may improve respiratory outcomes in preterm 
infants. Creatine is an organic acid with known anti-inflammatory and 
antioxidant properties. Objective To evaluate the efficacy of direct fetal 
creatine supplementation to reduce inflammation and oxidative stress in fetal 
lungs arising from an in utero pro-inflammatory stimulus. Methods Fetal lambs 
(n=51) were instrumented at 90 days gestation to receive a continuous infusion 
of creatine monohydrate (6 mgkg-1h-1) or saline for 17 days. Maternal 
chorioamnionitis was induced with intra-amniotic lipopolysaccharide (LPS; 1 mg, 
O55:H6) or saline seven days before delivery at 110 days gestation. Tissue 
creatine content was assessed with capillary electrophoresis, and inflammatory 
markers were analyzed with Luminex Magpix and immunohistochemistry. Oxidative 
stress was measured as the level of protein thiol oxidation. The effects of LPS 
and creatine were analyzed using a 2-way ANOVA. Results Fetal creatine 
supplementation increased lung creatine content by 149% (PCr<0.0001) and had no 
adverse effects on lung morphology. LPS-exposed groups showed increased levels 
of interleukin-8 in the bronchoalveolar lavage (PLPS<0.0001) and increased 
levels of CD45+ leukocytes (PLPS<0.0001) and MPO+ (PLPS<0.0001) cells in the 
lung parenchyma. Creatine supplementation significantly reduced the levels of 
CD45+ (PCr=0.045) and MPO+ cells (PCr=0.012) in the lungs and reduced thiol 
oxidation in plasma (PCr<0.01) and lung tissue (PCr=0.02). Conclusion Fetal 
creatine supplementation reduced markers of inflammation and oxidative stress in 
the fetal lungs arising from chorioamnionitis.

Aging-related sarcopenia is a degenerative loss of strength and skeletal muscle 
mass that impairs quality of life. Evaluating NUDT3 gene and myogenin expression 
as new diagnostic tools in sarcopenia. Also, comparing the concomitant treatment 
of resistance exercise (EX) and creatine monohydrate (CrM) versus single therapy 
by EX, coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10), and CrM using aged rats. Sixty male rats were 
equally divided into groups. The control group, aging group, EX-treated group, 
the CoQ10 group were administered (500 mg/kg) of CoQ10, the CrM group supplied 
(0.3 mg/kg of CrM), and a group of CrM concomitant with resistance exercise. 
Serum lipid profiles, certain antioxidant markers, electromyography (EMG), nudix 
hydrolase 3 (NUDT3) expression, creatine kinase (CK), and sarcopenic index 
markers were measured after 12 weeks. The gastrocnemius muscle was stained with 
hematoxylin-eosin (H&E) and myogenin. The EX-CrM combination showed significant 
improvement in serum lipid profile, antioxidant markers, EMG, NUDT3 gene, 
myogenin expression, CK, and sarcopenic index markers from other groups. The 
NUDT3 gene and myogenin expression have proven efficient as diagnostic tools for 
sarcopenia. Concomitant treatment of CrM and EX is preferable to individual 
therapy because it reduces inflammation, improves the lipid serum profile, 
promotes muscle regeneration, and thus has the potential to improve sarcopenia.

Preliminary studies demonstrated beneficial effects of dietary creatine across 
different post-viral fatigue syndromes. Creatine is often co-administered with 
glucose to improve its potency yet whether glucose boost the efficacy of 
creatine in long COVID remains currently unknown. In this report, we investigate 
the effects of 8-wk creatine intake with and without glucose on patient-reported 
outcomes, exercise tolerance, and tissue creatine levels in patients with long 
COVID. Fifteen male and female long COVID adult patients (age 39.7±16.0 y; 9 
women) with moderate fatigue and at least one of additional long COVID-related 
symptoms volunteered to participate in this randomized controlled parallel-group 
interventional trial. All patients were allocated in a double-blind 
parallel-group design (1 : 1 : 1) to receive creatine (8 g of creatine 
monohydrate per day), a mixture of creatine and glucose (8 g of creatine 
monohydrate and 3 g of glucose per day), or placebo (3 g of glucose per day) 
t.i.d. during an 8-wk intervention interval. Two-way ANOVA with repeated 
measures (treatment vs. time interaction) revealed significant differences in 
changes in total creatine levels between the groups, showing an interaction 
effect at two brain locations (right precentral white matter F=34.740, p=0.008; 
partial η2=0.72; left paracentral grey matter F=19.243, p=0.019; partial 
η2=0.88), with creatine and creatine-glucose outcompeted placebo to elevate 
creatine levels at these two locations. Several long COVID symptoms (including 
body aches, breathing problems, difficulties concentrating, headache, and 
general malaise) were significantly reduced in creatine-glucose group at 8-wk 
follow-up (p≤0.05); the effect sizes for reducing body aches, difficulties 
concentrating, and headache were 1.33, 0.80, and 1.12, respectively, suggesting 
a large effect of creatine-glucose mixture for these outcomes. Our preliminary 
findings suggest that supplying exogenous creatine with glucose could be 
recommended as an effective procedure in replenishing brain creatine pool and 
alleviating long COVID features in this prevalent condition.

BACKGROUND: Athletes commonly use creatine, caffeine, and sodium bicarbonate for 
performance enhancement. While their isolated effects are well-described, less 
is known about their potential additive effects.
METHODS: Following a baseline trial, we randomized 12 endurance-trained males 
(age: 25 ± 5 years, VO2max: 56.7 ± 4.6 mL kg-1 min-1; mean ± SD) and 11 females 
(age: 25 ± 3 years, VO2max: 50.2 ± 3.4 mL kg-1 min-1) to 5 days of creatine 
monohydrate (0.3 g kg-1 per day) or placebo loading, followed by a daily 
maintenance dose (0.04 g kg-1) throughout the study. After the loading period, 
subjects completed four trials in randomized order where they ingested caffeine 
(3 mg kg-1), sodium bicarbonate (0.3 g kg-1), placebo, or both caffeine and 
sodium bicarbonate before a maximal voluntary contraction (MVC), 15-s sprint, 
and 6-min time trial.
RESULTS: Compared to placebo, mean power output during 15-s sprint was higher 
following loading with creatine than placebo (+34 W, 95% CI: 10 to 58, 
p = 0.008), but with no additional effect of caffeine (+10 W, 95% CI: -7 to 24, 
p = 0.156) or sodium bicarbonate (+5 W, 95% CI: -4 to 13, p = 0.397). Mean power 
output during 6-min time trial was higher with caffeine (+12 W, 95% CI: 5 to 18, 
p = 0.001) and caffeine + sodium bicarbonate (+8 W, 95% CI: 0 to 15, p = 0.038), 
whereas sodium bicarbonate (-1 W, 95% CI: -7 to 6, p = 0.851) and creatine 
(-6 W, 95% CI: -15 to 4, p = 0.250) had no effects.
CONCLUSION: While creatine and caffeine can enhance sprint- and time trial 
performance, respectively, these effects do not seem additive. Therefore, 
supplementing with either creatine or caffeine appears sufficient to enhance 
sprint or short intense exercise performance.

BACKGROUND: Muscle mass is important for metastatic prostate cancer survival and 
quality of life (QoL). The backbone of treatment for men with metastatic 
castration sensitive prostate cancer (mCSPC) is androgen deprivation therapy 
(ADT) with an androgen signaling inhibitor. ADT is an effective cancer 
treatment, but it facilitates significant declines in muscle mass and adverse 
health outcomes important to mCSPC survivors, such as fatigue, and reductions in 
physical function, independence, insulin sensitivity, and QoL. In non-metastatic 
CSPC survivors, resistance training (RT) preserves muscle mass and improves 
these related health outcomes, but the biggest barrier to RT in CSPC survivors 
of all stages is fatigue. Creatine monohydrate supplementation coupled with RT 
(Cr + RT) may address this barrier since creatine plays a critical role in 
energy metabolism. Cr + RT in cancer-free older adults and other clinical 
populations improves muscle mass and related health outcomes. Evidence also 
suggests that creatine supplementation can complement cancer treatment. Thus, 
Cr + RT is a strategy that addresses gaps in survivorship needs of people with 
mCSPC. The purpose of this parallel, double-blind randomized controlled trial is 
to test the effects of 52-weeks of Cr + RT compared with placebo (PLA) and RT 
(PLA + RT) on muscle mass, other related health outcomes, and markers of cancer 
progression.
METHODS: We will carry out this trial with our team's established, effective, 
home-based, telehealth RT program in 200 mCSPC survivors receiving ADT, and 
evaluate outcomes at baseline, 24-, and 52-weeks. RT will occur twice weekly 
with elastic resistance bands, and an established creatine supplementation 
protocol will be used for supplementation delivery. Our approach addresses a 
major facilitator to RT in mCSPC survivors, a home-based RT program, while 
utilizing a supervised model for safety.
DISCUSSION: Findings will improve delivery of comprehensive survivorship care by 
providing a multicomponent, patient-centered lifestyle strategy to preserve 
muscle mass, improve health outcomes, and complement cancer treatment 
(NCT06112990).

Despite the known beneficial effects of creatine in treating exercise-induced 
muscle damage (EIMD), its effectiveness remains unclear. This study investigates 
the recovery effect of creatine monohydrate (CrM) on EIMD. Twenty healthy men 
(21-36 years) were subjected to stratified, randomized, double-blind 
assignments. The creatine (CRE) and placebo (PLA) groups ingested creatine and 
crystalline cellulose, respectively, for 28 days. They subsequently performed 
dumbbell exercises while emphasizing eccentric contraction of the elbow flexors. 
The EIMD was evaluated before and after exercise. The range of motion was 
significantly higher in the CRE group than in the PLA group 24 h (h) post 
exercise. A similar difference was detected in maximum voluntary contraction at 
0, 48, 96, and 168 h post exercise (p = 0.017-0.047). The upper arm 
circumference was significantly lower in the CRE group than in the PLA group at 
48, 72, 96, and 168 h post exercise (p = 0.002-0.030). Similar variation was 
observed in the shear modulus of the biceps brachii muscle at 96 and 168 h post 
exercise (p = 0.003-0.021) and in muscle fatigue at 0 and 168 h post exercise (p 
= 0.012-0.032). These findings demonstrate CrM-mediated accelerated recovery 
from EIMD, suggesting that CrM is an effective supplement for EIMD recovery.

Hemodialysis has a detrimental effect on fat-free mass (FFM) and muscle strength 
over time. Thus, we aimed to evaluate the effect of creatine supplementation on 
the body composition and Malnutrition-Inflammation Score (MIS) in patients with 
chronic kidney disease (CKD) undergoing hemodialysis. An exploratory 1-year 
balanced, placebo-controlled, and double-blind design was conducted with 
hemodialysis patients (≥18 years). The creatine group (CG) received 5 g of 
creatine monohydrate and 5 g of maltodextrin per day and the placebo group (PG) 
received 10 g of maltodextrin per day. MIS and body composition were analyzed at 
three time points: pre, intermediate (after 6 months), and post (after 12 
months). After 6 months, 60% of patients on creatine experienced an increase in 
FFM compared to a 36.8% increase for those on placebo. Moreover, 65% of patients 
on creatine increased their skeletal muscle mass index (SMMI) compared to only 
15.8% for those on placebo. Creatine increased intracellular water (ICW) in 60% 
of patients. MIS did not change after the intervention. In the CG, there was an 
increase in body weight (p = 0.018), FFM (p = 0.010), SMMI (p = 0.022). CG also 
increased total body water (pre 35.4 L, post 36.1 L; p = 0.008), mainly due to 
ICW (pre 20.2 L, intermediate 20.7 L, post 21.0 L; p = 0.016). Long-term 
creatine supplementation in hemodialysis patients did not attenuate the MIS, but 
enhanced FFM and SMMI, which was likely triggered by an increase in ICW.

BACKGROUND: Impaired brain bioenergetics is a pathological hallmark of 
Alzheimer's disease (AD) and is a compelling target for AD treatment. Patients 
with AD exhibit dysfunction in the brain creatine (Cr) system, which is integral 
in maintaining bioenergetic flux. Recent studies in AD mouse models suggest Cr 
supplementation improves brain mitochondrial function and may be protective of 
AD peptide pathology and cognition.
AIMS: The Creatine to Augment Bioenergetics in Alzheimer's disease (CABA) study 
is designed to primarily assess the feasibility of supplementation with 20 g/day 
of creatine monohydrate (CrM) in patients with cognitive impairment due to AD. 
Secondary aims are designed to generate preliminary data investigating changes 
in brain Cr levels, cognition, peripheral and brain mitochondrial function, and 
muscle strength and size.
METHODS: CABA is an 8-week, single-arm pilot study that will recruit 20 patients 
with cognitive impairment due to AD. Participants attend five in-person study 
visits: two visits at baseline to conduct screening and baseline assessments, a 
4-week visit, and two 8-week visits. Outcomes assessment includes recruitment, 
retention, and compliance, cognitive testing, magnetic resonance spectroscopy of 
brain metabolites, platelet and lymphocyte mitochondrial function, and muscle 
strength and morphology at baseline and 8 weeks.
DISCUSSION: CABA is the first study to investigate CrM as a potential treatment 
in patients with AD. The pilot data generated by this study are pertinent to 
inform the design of future large-scale efficacy trials.

(1) Background: Given the physiological characteristics of handball, players may 
require the use of certain sports supplements (SS). However, very few studies 
have investigated the consumption of SS in handball. The aims were to determine 
the number of handball players who consume SS, to analyze their SS consumption 
pattern according to gender and competitive level, and to assess whether the SS 
they consume are supported by scientific evidence, and to which group they 
belong according to the classification of the Australian Institute of Sport 
(AIS). (2) Methods: A descriptive-correlational study was carried out on the 
habitual consumption of SS in 360 federated Spanish players by using a 
self-administered and validated questionnaire. (3) Results: These showed 65.8% 
of the sample consumed SS. According to the total number of participants, the 
most consumed supplements were from Group A: sports drinks (30.8%) and whey 
protein (30.4%). When analyzing the data by gender, the men's consumption was 
significantly higher for whey protein (p < 0.001), caffeine (p = 0.009), and 
creatine monohydrate (p < 0.001). When analyzed by competitive level, the 
provincial category players group showed a significantly lower consumption than 
the rest of the groups for protein bars (p = 0.038), whey protein (p = 0.005) 
and creatine monohydrate (p < 0.001), while the honor division group showed a 
significantly higher intake of creatine monohydrate than the remaining groups (p 
< 0.001). (4) Conclusions: The handball players showed a moderate consumption of 
SS, without using substances that were not supported by scientific evidence and 
opting in most cases for supplements belonging to group A from the AIS 
classification. Men tended to consume more SS, and SS consumption increased 
based on competitive level.

The most dynamic period throughout the lifespan of broiler chickens is the 
pre-post-hatching period, entailing profound effects on their energy status, 
survival rate, body weight, and muscle growth. Given the significance of this 
pivotal period, we evaluated the effect of in-ovo feeding (IOF) with creatine 
monohydrate on late-term embryos' and hatchlings' energy reserves and post-hatch 
breast muscle development. The results demonstrate that IOF with creatine 
elevates the levels of high-energy-value molecules (creatine and glycogen) in 
the liver, breast muscle and yolk sac tissues 48 h post IOF, on embryonic day 19 
(p < 0.03). Despite this evidence, using a novel automated image analysis tool 
on day 14 post-hatch, we found a significantly higher number of myofibers with 
lower diameter and area in the IOF creatine group compared to the control and 
IOF NaCl groups (p < 0.004). Gene expression analysis, at hatch, revealed that 
IOF creatine group had significantly higher expression levels of myogenin (MYOG) 
and insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1), related to differentiation of myogenic 
cells (p < 0.01), and lower expression of myogenic differentiation protein 1 
(MyoD), related to their proliferation (p < 0.04). These results imply a 
possible effect of IOF with creatine on breast muscle development through 
differential expression of genes involved in myogenic proliferation and 
differentiation. The findings provide valuable insights into the potential of 
pre-hatch enrichment with creatine in modulating post-hatch muscle growth and 
development.

OBJECTIVES: The present study aimed to 1) investigate the consumption of Sports 
Supplements (SSs) among female elite football players, 2) evaluate the influence 
of age on SS consumption, and 3) determine the relationship between the 
consumption of SSs and dietary choices among elite football players.
METHODS: A total of 126 female football players of Primera Iberdrola and Reto 
Iberdrola who participated in this descriptive, observational, and 
cross-sectional study completed a self-administered questionnaire on SSs and the 
Athletes' Food Choices Questionnaire.
RESULTS: Overall, 84.1% of participants consumed supplements, mainly for 
improved sports performance (68.3%) and health (34.1%). The main sources of 
purchase were the Internet (34.9%) and specialized shops (23.8%), and players 
were commonly advised by a dietitian-nutritionist to use SSs (56.3%). The SSs 
most often consumed included whey protein (30.2%), sports drinks (28.6%), 
creatine monohydrate (28.6%), sports bars (27.8%), and caffeine (27.8%). Older 
players consumed more supplements at the time of data compilation. Players 
predominantly acquired these supplements by using the Internet and reported 
benefits from their use (all P ≤ 0.036). Additionally, players who consumed SSs 
conveyed more concern about their food choices.
CONCLUSIONS: A high prevalence of female football players consumed SSs, 
particularly SSs supported by robust scientific evidence. Older players had 
higher supplement consumption rates. The use of SSs was related to food choices 
through nutritional characteristics of foods, knowledge about health and 
nutrition, weight control with the help of food, and the performance benefits 
players could acquire.

Dietary creatine has been recently put forward as a possible intervention 
strategy to reduce post-COVID-19 fatigue syndrome yet no clinical study so far 
evaluated its efficacy and safety for this perplexing condition. In this 
parallel-group, randomized placebo-controlled double-blind trial, we analyzed 
the effects of 6-month creatine supplementation (4 g of creatine monohydrate per 
day) on various patient- and clinician-reported outcomes, and tissue creatine 
levels in 12 patients with post-COVID-19 fatigue syndrome. Creatine intake 
induced a significant increase in tissue creatine levels in vastus medialis 
muscle and right parietal white matter compared to the baseline values at both 
3-month and 6-month follow-ups (p < .05). Two-way analysis of variance with 
repeated measures revealed a significant difference (treatment vs. time 
interaction) between interventions in tissue creatine levels (p < .05), with the 
creatine group was superior to placebo to augment creatine levels at vastus 
medialis muscle, left frontal white matter, and right parietal white matter. 
Creatine supplementation induced a significant reduction in general fatigue 
after 3 months of intake compared to baseline values (p = .04), and 
significantly improved scores for several post-COVID-19 fatigue syndrome-related 
symptoms (e.g., ageusia, breathing difficulties, body aches, headache, and 
difficulties concentrating) at 6-month follow-up (p < .05). Taking creatine for 
6 months appears to improve tissue bioenergetics and attenuate clinical features 
of post-COVID-19 fatigue syndrome; additional studies are warranted to confirm 
our findings in various post-COVID-19 cohorts.

justyna.batkowska@up.lublin.pl.

The experiment was implemented to assess the influence of dietary 
supplementation of laying quails with creatine monohydrate (CrM), L-carnitine 
(CAR) and their mixture (CrMCAR) as antioxidants against oxidative stress (OS) 
induced by 2.5 ppm lead acetate (LA) in drinking water on productive, 
physiological and microbial aspects. In total, 400 laying quail females at 10 wk 
of age were divided into a randomized design with 5 groups and 4 replicates of 
20 birds each. Birds were fed ad libitum with a balanced diet for 8 wk. The 
control group was kept under no-stress conditions and was given fresh water 
without any additives (G1). While birds in other groups were exposed to OS 
induced experimentally by 2.5 ppm LA in drinking water with no feed additive 
(G2) or supplemented with 500 mg/kg CrM (G3) or 500 mg/kg CAR (G4) or 
combination of 250 mg/kg each of CrM and CAR (CrMCAR, G5) to feed mixture. 
Compared to G2, G5 demonstrated the reduction (P ≤ 0.05) of feed conversion 
ratio, feed intake, mortality and ileal total coliform, as well as serum and egg 
malondialdehyde and serum lipid hydroperoxide, uric acid, glucose, cholesterol, 
enzymatic activities (alanine aminotransferase, aspartate transaminase, alkaline 
phosphatase, creatine phosphokinase, γ-glutamyl transferase), and 
heterophils/lymphocytes ratio. In the meanwhile, there was an increase (P ≤ 
0.05) in egg production, egg mass, and weight with the improvement of egg 
quality, serum sex hormones level and ileal lactic acid bacteria for G5 followed 
by G4 and G3. Moreover, G5 enhanced (P ≤ 0.05), the total antioxidant capacity 
of egg and serum glutathione, superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione 
peroxidase, protein and calcium levels. Therefore, dietary CrMCAR, CAR and CrM 
have analogous influence to control by improving the antioxidant and 
physiological parameters which resulted in better productive performance and egg 
characteristics of stressed quails. These antioxidants, especially in their 
equal combination, are beneficial to alleviate oxidative stress incidence and 
can be recommended for poultry feeding under various aspects of environmental 
stresses.

BACKGROUND: Acute fluid ingestion increases estimated body fat percentage (BF%) 
measurements by single frequency (SF-BIA) and multi-frequency bioelectrical 
impedance (MF-BIA). It is unknown if MF-BIA accurately measures total BF% and 
total body water (TBW) after creatine supplementation, which causes fluid 
retention, and resultant increases in fat-free mass and TBW. The purpose of this 
study was to analyze the effect of creatine supplementation on body composition 
and TBW measured through a popular MF-BIA device (InBody 770).
METHODS: Thirteen male and 14 female subjects (18-22 years) completed one week 
of creatine monohydrate (0.3 g/kg body weight) or maltodextrin. Pre- and 
post-supplementation body composition measurements included dual-energy X-ray 
absorptiometry (DEXA), SF-BIA measured by an Omron HBF-306C device, and MF-BIA 
measured by an InBody 770 device to measure BF%, fat free mass (FFM), and fat 
mass (FM). Additionally, intracellular water (ICW), extracellular water (ECW), 
and TBW were estimated by MF- BIA.
RESULTS: FFM increased more in the creatine group than the placebo group 
measured by all body composition modes (1.2 kg, 1.9 kg, and 1.1 kg increase for 
SF-BIA, MF-BIA, and DEXA respectively, P<0.05). Creatine supplementation 
resulted in a 2% increase (P<0.05) in TBW measured by MF-BIA (40.4±9.5 to 
41.2±9.6 kg).
CONCLUSIONS: One week of creatine supplementation increased TBW as detected by 
the InBody 770 device. Changes in body composition that occurred due to the 
increase in TBW were detected as an increase in FFM measured by SF-BIA, MF-BIA, 
and DEXA.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The purpose of this opinion paper is to provide current-day 
and evidence-based information regarding dietary supplements that support 
resistance training adaptations or acutely enhance strength-power or endurance 
performance.
RECENT FINDINGS: Several independent lines of evidence support that higher 
protein diets, which can be readily achieved through animal-based protein 
supplements, optimize muscle mass during periods of resistance training, and 
this likely facilitates strength increases. Creatine monohydrate supplementation 
and peri-exercise caffeine consumption also enhance strength and power through 
distinct mechanisms. Supplements that favorably affect aspects of endurance 
performance include peri-exercise caffeine, nitrate-containing supplements 
(e.g., beet root juice), and sodium bicarbonate consumption. Further, 
beta-alanine supplementation can enhance high-intensity endurance exercise 
efforts.
SUMMARY: Select dietary supplements can enhance strength and endurance outcomes, 
and take-home recommendations will be provided for athletes and practitioners 
aiming to adopt these strategies.

Creatine supplementation improves anaerobic performance and recovery; however, 
to date, these outcomes have not been well explored in females. This study 
evaluated the effect of creatine monohydrate loading on exercise recovery, 
measured by heart rate variability (HRV) and repeated sprint performance, in 
women across the menstrual cycle. In this randomized, double-blind, cross-over 
study, 39 women (mean ± standard deviation: age: 24.6 ± 5.9 years, height: 172.5 
± 42.3 cm, weight: 65.1 ± 8.1 kg, BF: 27.4 ± 5.8%) were randomized to a creatine 
monohydrate (n = 19; 20 g per day in 4 × 5 g doses) or non-caloric PL group (n = 
20). HRV was measured at rest and after participants completed a repeated sprint 
cycling test (10 × 6 s maximal sprints). Measurements were conducted before and 
after supplementation in the follicular/low hormone and luteal/high hormone 
phases. Creatine monohydrate supplementation did not influence HRV values, as no 
significant differences were seen in HRV values at rest or postexercise. For 
repeated sprint outcomes, there was a significant phase × supplement interaction 
(p = 0.048) for fatigue index, with the greatest improvement seen in high 
hormone in the creatine monohydrate group (-5.8 ± 19.0%) compared to changes in 
the PL group (0.1 ± 8.1%). Sprint performance and recovery were reduced by the 
high hormone for both groups. Though not statistically significant, the data 
suggests that creatine monohydrate could help counteract performance decrements 
caused by the high hormone. This data can help inform creatine monohydrate 
loading strategies for females, demonstrating potential benefits in the high 
hormone phase.

AIMS: Sarcopenia generally refers to the age-related reduction in muscle 
strength, functional ability, and muscle mass. Sarcopenia is a multifactorial 
condition associated with poor glucose disposal, insulin resistance, and 
subsequently type 2 diabetes (T2D). The pathophysiological connection between 
sarcopenia and T2D is complex but likely involves glycemic control, 
inflammation, oxidative stress, and adiposity.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Resistance exercise and aerobic training are two lifestyle 
interventions that may improve glycemic control in older adults with T2D and 
counteract sarcopenia. Further, there is evidence that dietary protein, Omega-3 
fatty acids, creatine monohydrate, and Vitamin D hold potential to augment some 
of these benefits from exercise.
CONCLUSIONS: The purpose of this narrative review is: (1) discuss the 
pathophysiological link between age-related sarcopenia and T2D, and (2) discuss 
lifestyle interventions involving physical activity and nutrition that may 
counteract sarcopenia and T2D.

University, Sanliurfa, Turkey. abdullahtaskin52@yahoo.com.

OBJECTIVE: In acute and chronic aerobic exercise, skeletal muscle and liver are 
the main organs that adapt and regulate metabolic activity. The levels of 
nitrosative stress caused by exercise in these organs are extremely important in 
the continuity of exercise, its health-promoting benefits, and the evaluation of 
therapeutic efficacy. In this study, nitrosative stress levels were investigated 
in musculus quadriceps femoris tissue and liver tissue of mice that were given 
low and high-speed aerobic running exercise and also received Cr 
supplementation.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this study, nitrosative stress levels were 
investigated in the muscle/liver tissue of 42 BALB/c mice that were given low 
and high-speed aerobic running exercise and creatine monohydrate (Cr) (40 mg/kg 
of diet daily) supplementation with exercise. The study included six groups with 
and without Cr supplementation, low-speed aerobic running, high-speed aerobic 
running, and no exercise. The mice in groups with low-speed and high-speed 
aerobic exercise with and without Cr supplementation were run on the treadmill 
for 8 weeks. Then, nitric oxide (NO·), nitric oxide synthase (NOS), and 
peroxynitrite (ONOO-) levels in muscle/liver tissue were measured by 
spectrophotometric method.
RESULTS: It was found that the nitrosative stress level in the groups that did 
low and high-speed aerobic running exercises increased compared to the group 
that did not exercise. It was found that NO· decreased NOS activity and ONOO- 
level increased in muscle tissues of low and high-speed aerobic exercise groups 
that received Cr supplementation compared to those that did not. However, NO· 
and ONOO- levels in liver tissue decreased while NOS activity did not change. 
The lowest level of nitrosative stress in both muscle and liver tissue was found 
in the low-speed exercise group receiving Cr supplementation.
CONCLUSIONS: Although supplements in exercise are an important component, the 
simultaneously measured nitrosative stress level is critical in determining the 
optimal exercise.

BACKGROUND: Mild traumatic brain injury or concussion is a global public 
concern, with an estimated annual incidence between 48 million and 96 million 
worldwide. It is a socioeconomical problem, and almost one-third of individuals 
with concussion suffer from severe persistent post-concussive symptoms (PPCS), 
with an increased risk of unemployment or terminating their studies. To date, no 
single treatment is available with guaranteed success. Creatine monohydrate 
(CrM) has shown potential as a treatment for post-concussive symptoms, having a 
positive impact on cognitive function, chronic fatigue, depression, and anxiety. 
The aim of this study is to examine the effect of CrM on PPCS assessed using the 
Rivermead Post-Concussion Symptoms Questionnaire (RPQ).
METHODS: The study is designed as a double-blinded randomised controlled trial. 
Study participants are found through neurological outpatient clinics in Denmark 
or through social media. They will be between 25 and 35 years of age, will have 
suffered from PPCS for 6-12 months prior to inclusion, and will have no 
comorbidities. The participants will be randomly allocated to either an 
intervention group (INT), placebo group (PLA), or control group (CG). Baseline 
data will be collected immediately after inclusion, and the study period will be 
7 weeks. Follow-up data will be collected 1 week after the end of the study 
period. The primary outcome of the study is changes in RPQ score. Changes in 
weight and training status will be adjusted for as potential confounders.
ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: This protocol is approved by the National Committee on 
Health Research (97508) and by the Danish Data Protection Agency 11.651. The 
investigators intend to submit their study findings for publication in 
peer-reviewed journals and disseminate the findings via presentation at academic 
meetings/conferences.Clinical Trial registration: NCT05562232, registered 
September 30, 2022.

There is emerging interest regarding the potential beneficial effects of 
creatine supplementation on indices of brain health and function. Creatine 
supplementation can increase brain creatine stores, which may help explain some 
of the positive effects on measures of cognition and memory, especially in aging 
adults or during times of metabolic stress (i.e., sleep deprivation). 
Furthermore, creatine has shown promise for improving health outcome measures 
associated with muscular dystrophy, traumatic brain injury (including 
concussions in children), depression, and anxiety. However, whether any sex- or 
age-related differences exist in regard to creatine and indices of brain health 
and function is relatively unknown. The purpose of this narrative review is to: 
(1) provide an up-to-date summary and discussion of the current body of research 
focusing on creatine and indices of brain health and function and (2) discuss 
possible sex- and age-related differences in response to creatine 
supplementation on brain bioenergetics, measures of brain health and function, 
and neurological diseases.

Effective treatment of choreaballism due to an MT-CYB variant with haloperidol, 
tetrabenazine, and antioxidants.

Hypokinetic and hyperkinetic movement disorders are a common phenotypic feature 
of mitochondrial disorders. Choreaballism has been reported particularly in 
patients with mitochondrial encephalopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like 
episodes syndrome and in maternally inherited diabetes and deafness syndrome. 
The pathophysiological basis of movement disorders in mitochondrial disorders is 
the involvement of the basal ganglia or the midbrain. Haloperidol and 
mitochondrial cocktails have proven beneficial in some of these cases. Here we 
present another patient with mitochondrial choreaballism who benefited 
significantly from symptomatic therapy. The patient is a 14-year-old male with a 
history of hypoacusis, ptosis, and focal tonic-clonic seizures of the 
upper/lower limbs on either side since childhood. Since this time he has also 
developed occasional, abnormal involuntary limb movements, choreaballism, facial 
grimacing, carpopedal spasms, and abnormal lip sensations. He was diagnosed with 
a non-syndromic mitochondrial disorder after detection of the variant 
m.15043G > A in MT-CYB. Seizures have been successfully treated with 
lamotrigine. Hypocalcemia was treated with intravenous calcium. For 
hypoparathyroidism calcitriol was given. Choreaballism was treated with 
haloperidol and tetrabenazine. In addition, he received coenzyme Q10, 
L-carnitine, thiamine, riboflavin, alpha-lipoic acid, biotin, vitamin-C, 
vitamin-E, and creatine-monohydrate. With this therapy, the choreaballism 
disappeared completely. This case shows that mitochondrial disorders can 
manifest with cognitive impairment, seizures, movement disorder, hypoacusis, 
endocrinopathy, cardiomyopathy, neuropathy, and myopathy, that choreaballism can 
be a phenotypic feature of multisystem mitochondrial disorders, and that 
choreaballism favorably responds to haloperidol, tetrabenazine, and possibly to 
a cocktail of antioxidants, cofactors, and vitamins.

A pre-workout supplement's (PWS; 200 mg caffeine, 3.3 g creatine monohydrate, 
3.2 g β-alanine, 6 g citrulline malate and 5 g branched chained amino acid 
(BCAA) per dose) acute effects on the alactic (jumping, sprinting, agility), 
lactic (Running-Based Anaerobic Sprint Test, RAST) and aerobic performance 
(Yo-Yo Intermittent Recovery Test Level 1, Yo-Yo IRL1 VO2max) of well-trained 
basketball players was investigated in this double-blind placebo-controlled 
study. Thirty players (age 18-31 years, height 166-195 cm, weight 70.2-116.7 kg, 
body fat 10.6-26.4%) were allocated to pre-workout (PWS, n = 15) or placebo (PL, 
n = 15) groups. Half of the participants in each group performed the evaluations 
without PWS or PL, while the rest consumed PWS or PL 30 min before the 
assessments (1st trial) and vice versa (2nd trial). Significant improvements in 
counter-movement jump (CMJ) (PWS: 4.3 ± 2.1%; PL: 1.2 ± 1.0%), agility (PWS: 
-2.9 ± 1.8%; PL: 1.8 ± 1.7%), RAST average (PWS: 18.3 ± 9.1%; PL: -2.2 ± 2.0%), 
minimum power (PWS: 13.7 ± 8.9%; PL: -7.5 ± 5.9%), and fatigue index (PWS: -25.0 
± 0.9%; PL: -4.6 ± 0.6%) were observed in the PWS group vs. the PL group (p < 
0.05). No differences were found regarding sprinting, aerobic performance, and 
blood lactate concentrations. Thus, although players' alactic and lactic 
anaerobic performance could be improved, peak power, sprinting and aerobic 
performance are not.

The role of resistance training and creatine supplementation on oxidative 
stress, antioxidant defense, muscle strength, and quality of life in older 
adults.

Amiri E(1), Sheikholeslami-Vatani D(1).

Author information:
(1)Department of Sport Sciences, University of Kurdistan, Sanandaj, Iran.

BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of resistance 
training (RT) with creatine monohydrate supplementation (CS) on serum levels of 
8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine (8-OHdG), malondialdehyde (MDA), glutathione peroxidase 
(GPX), and total antioxidant capacity (TAC) in older adults.
OBJECTIVES: This study evaluated the effect of resistance training with creatine 
monohydrate supplementation on oxidative stress and antioxidant defense, muscle 
strength and quality of life in older adults.
METHODS: We examined 45 non-athlete volunteer older men and women (mean, 
68.1 ± 7.2  years old), were randomly selected and divided into three groups of 
15: RT with creatine supplementation (RT + CS), RT with placebo (RT + P) and 
control group. RT protocol was performed for 10  weeks, three sessions per week. 
Creatine supplement was taken daily at a dose of 0.1 g/kg of body weight, while 
the placebo group consumed the same amount of starch. Fasting blood samples were 
taken before the start of program and at the end of the RT period.
RESULTS: In the training groups, after 10  weeks of RT, a significant decrease 
in MDA and 8 - OHDG as well as a significant increase in serum levels of GPX and 
TAC were observed (in all cases, p =  0.001). In addition, creatinine levels 
were enhanced in the RT + CS (p =  0.014). Training intervention also improved 
quality of life and muscle strength in the experimental groups (p =  0.001), 
although muscle strength changes were more visible in the RT + CS group than in 
the RT + P group (p <  0/05).
CONCLUSION: Regular resistance training can be recommended as a very suitable 
non-pharmacological approach to strengthen the body's antioxidant system, muscle 
strength and quality of life in older adults. There are no definite findings on 
the role of creatine on the antioxidant system and quality of life in older 
adults, but the use of this supplement in addition to RT can double the amount 
of strength gained from resistance training.

PURPOSE: Our purpose was to examine the effects of 2 yr of creatine monohydrate 
supplementation and exercise on bone health in postmenopausal women.
METHODS: Two hundred and thirty-seven postmenopausal women (mean age, 59 yr) 
were randomized to receive creatine (0.14 g·kg -1 ·d -1 ) or placebo during a 
resistance training (3 d·wk -1 ) and walking (6 d·wk -1 ) program for 2 yr. Our 
primary outcome was the femoral neck bone mineral density (BMD), with lumbar 
spine BMD and proximal femur geometric properties as the secondary outcomes.
RESULTS: Compared with placebo, creatine supplementation had no effect on BMD of 
the femoral neck (creatine: 0.725 ± 0.110 to 0.712 ± 0.100 g·cm -2 ; placebo: 
0.721 ± 0.102 to 0.706 ± 0.097 g·cm -2 ), total hip (creatine: 0.879 ± 0.118 to 
0.872 ± 0.114 g·cm -2 ; placebo: 0.881 ± 0.111 to 0.873 ± 0.109 g·cm -2 ), or 
lumbar spine (creatine: 0.932 ± 0.133 to 0.925 ± 0.131 g·cm -2 ; placebo: 0.923 
± 0.145 to 0.915 ± 0.143 g·cm -2 ). Creatine significantly maintained section 
modulus (1.35 ± 0.29 to 1.34 ± 0.26 vs 1.34 ± 0.25 to 1.28 ± 0.23 cm 3 
(placebo), P = 0.0011), predictive of bone bending strength, and buckling ratio 
(10.8 ± 2.6 to 11.1 ± 2.2 vs 11.0 ± 2.6 to 11.6 ± 2.7 (placebo), P = 0.011), 
predictive of reduced cortical bending under compressive loads, at the narrow 
part of the femoral neck. Creatine reduced walking time over 80 m (48.6 ± 5.6 to 
47.1 ± 5.4 vs 48.3 ± 4.5 to 48.2 ± 4.9 s (placebo), P = 0.0008) but had no 
effect on muscular strength (i.e., one-repetition maximum) during bench press 
(32.1 ± 12.7 to 42.6 ± 14.1 vs 30.6 ± 10.9 to 41.4 ± 14 kg (placebo)) and hack 
squat (57.6 ± 21.6 to 84.4 ± 28.1 vs 56.6 ± 24.0 to 82.7 ± 25.0 kg (placebo)). 
In the subanalysis of valid completers, creatine increased lean tissue mass 
compared with placebo (40.8 ± 5.7 to 43.1 ± 5.9 vs 40.4 ± 5.3 to 42.0 ± 5.2 kg 
(placebo), P = 0.046).
CONCLUSIONS: Two years of creatine supplementation and exercise in 
postmenopausal women had no effect on BMD; yet, it improved some bone geometric 
properties at the proximal femur.

Prior research has documented the connection between social media use and 
engaging with fitspiration with body dissatisfaction, disordered eating 
behaviors, and various health risk behaviors (e.g., substance use). However, 
gaps remain in the knowledge base on whether social media use and engaging with 
fitness- and weight-related online content are associated with the use of legal 
appearance- and performance-enhancing drugs and substances (APEDS; e.g., whey 
protein), which was the aim of this study. Data from participants ages 
16-30 years in Canadian Study of Adolescent Health Behaviors (N = 2731) were 
analyzed. Multiple modified Poisson regression analyses were conducted to 
determine the associations between hours per day of social media use and any 
engagement with fitness- and weight-related online content in the past 30 days 
and use of 10 different legal APEDS in the past 30 days. Greater time on social 
media was significantly associated with use of energy drinks and pre-workout 
drinks or powders in the past 30 days. Engaging with fitness- and weight-related 
online content was significantly associated with the use of caffeine, creatine 
monohydrate, pre-workout drinks or powders, probiotics, protein bars, and whey 
protein powders or shakes in the past 30 days. These findings expand prior 
research on the correlates of social media use and engagement with fitness- and 
weight-related online content among young people and have important implications 
for healthcare and public health professionals, as well as technology companies.

Collegiate dance is unique because it requires athletic and academic 
performance; therefore, optimizing physical and mental function is crucial. 
Research among athletic populations demonstrate improvements in body 
composition, performance, and cognition following creatine monohydrate (CR) 
supplementation, yet dancers have not been investigated. The purpose of this 
study was to determine the effects of CR supplementation on body composition, 
performance, and cognitive function in female collegiate dancers. Participants 
were randomized to CR (CR; n = 7; 0.1 g·kg -1·day -1 CM +0.1 g·kg -1·day -1 
corn-starch maltodextrin) or placebo (PL; n = 6; 0.2 g·kg -1·day -1 corn-starch 
maltodextrin) for 42 days. Pre- and post-testing included body composition, 
total body water (TBW), Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale, Diet History 
Questionnaire, the National Institute of Health Toolbox fluid cognition battery 
and isokinetic strength, vertical jump, medicine ball throw, and Wingate 
anaerobic power test. CR demonstrated a significant increase in TBW (pre, 
32.2 ± 3.5 kg; post, 32.7 ± 3.6 kg; p = 0.024) and lean mass (LM; pre, 
39.8 ± 3.6 kg; post, 41.5 ± 4.5 kg; p = 0.020). CR supplementation may be an 
effective strategy to increase TBW and estimates of LM in female collegiate 
dancers. Although this may optimize aesthetics, larger samples sizes with 
resistance training are needed to determine if CR supplementation increases 
muscle mass and translates to improved performance.

BACKGROUND: There is robust evidence that creatine monohydrate supplementation 
can enhance short-term high-intensity exercise in athletes. However, the effect 
of creatine monohydrate supplementation on aerobic performance and its role 
during aerobic activities is still controversial.
OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to 
evaluate the supplementation effects of creatine monohydrate on endurance 
performance in a trained population.
METHODS: The search strategy in this systematic review and meta-analysis was 
designed following Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and 
Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines, and PubMed/MEDLINE, Web of Science, and 
Scopus databases were explored from inception until 19 May, 2022. Only human 
experimental trials, controlled with a placebo group, evaluating the effects of 
creatine monohydrate supplementation on endurance performance in a trained 
population were analyzed in this systematic review and meta-analysis. The 
methodological quality of included studies was evaluated using the Physiotherapy 
Evidence Database (PEDro) scale.
RESULTS: A total of 13 studies satisfied all the eligibility criteria and were 
included in this systematic review and meta-analysis. The results for the pooled 
meta-analysis showed a non-significant change in endurance performance after 
creatine monohydrate supplementation in a trained population (p = 0.47), with a 
trivial negative effect (pooled standardized mean difference =  - 0.07 [95% 
confidence interval - 0.32 to 0.18]; I2 = 34.75%). Further, after excluding the 
studies not evenly distributed around the base of the funnel plot, the results 
were similar (pooled standardized mean difference =  - 0.07 [95% confidence 
interval - 0.27 to 0.13]; I2 = 0%; p = 0.49).
CONCLUSIONS: Creatine monohydrate supplementation was shown to be ineffective on 
endurance performance in a trained population.
CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION: The study protocol was registered in the 
Prospective Register of Systematic Review (PROSPERO) with the following 
registration number: CRD42022327368.

It is estimated that three to five million sports injuries occur worldwide each 
year. The highest incidence is reported during competition periods with mainly 
affectation of the musculoskeletal tissue. For appropriate nutritional 
management and correct use of nutritional supplements, it is important to 
individualize based on clinical effects and know the adaptive response during 
the rehabilitation phase after a sports injury in athletes. Therefore, the aim 
of this PRISMA in Exercise, Rehabilitation, Sport Medicine and Sports Science 
PERSiST-based systematic integrative review was to perform an update on 
nutritional strategies during the rehabilitation phase of musculoskeletal 
injuries in elite athletes. After searching the following databases: 
PubMed/Medline, Scopus, PEDro, and Google Scholar, a total of 18 studies met the 
inclusion criteria (Price Index: 66.6%). The risk of bias assessment for 
randomized controlled trials was performed using the RoB 2.0 tool while review 
articles were evaluated using the AMSTAR 2.0 items. Based on the main findings 
of the selected studies, nutritional strategies that benefit the rehabilitation 
process in injured athletes include balanced energy intake, and a high-protein 
and carbohydrate-rich diet. Supportive supervision should be provided to avoid 
low energy availability. The potential of supplementation with collagen, 
creatine monohydrate, omega-3 (fish oils), and vitamin D requires further 
research although the effects are quite promising. It is worth noting the lack 
of clinical research in injured athletes and the higher number of reviews in the 
last 10 years. After analyzing the current quantitative and non-quantitative 
evidence, we encourage researchers to conduct further clinical research studies 
evaluating doses of the discussed nutrients during the rehabilitation process to 
confirm findings, but also follow international guidelines at the time to review 
scientific literature.

This study aimed to compare the effects of an 8-week creatine (CR) or placebo 
(PL) supplementation on muscle strength, thickness, endurance, and body 
composition employing different training paradigms with blood flow restriction 
(BFR) vs. traditional resistance training (TRAD). Seventeen healthy males were 
randomized between the PL (n = 9) and CR (n = 8) groups. Participants were 
trained unilaterally utilizing a within-between subject bicep curl exercise 
where each arm was allocated to TRAD or BFR for 8 weeks. Muscular strength, 
thickness, endurance, and body composition were evaluated. Creatine 
supplementation promoted increases in muscle thickness in TRAD and BFR compared 
with their placebo counterparts, however, without a significant difference 
between treatments (p = 0.349). TRAD training increased maximum strength (1 
repetition maximum (1RM)) compared with BFR after 8 weeks of training 
(p = 0.021). Repetitions to failure at 30% of 1RM were increased in the BFR-CR 
group compared with the TRAD-CR group (p = 0.004). Repetitions to failure at 70% 
1RM were increased from weeks 0-4 (p < 0.05) and 4-8 (p < 0.05) in all groups. 
Creatine supplementation exerted a hypertrophic effect when utilized with TRAD 
and BFR paradigms and increased muscle performance at 30% 1RM when utilized in 
conjunction with BFR. Therefore, creatine supplementation seems to amplify 
muscle adaptation following a BFR program. Registered in the Brazilian Registry 
of Clinical Trials (ReBEC), under the registration number: RBR-3vh8zgj.

BACKGROUND: The aims of this study were to analyse the effect of creatine 
supplementation on the performance improvement in a bench pressing (BP) strength 
test of muscle failure and to evaluate muscle fatigue and metabolic stress 20 
min after the exercise.
METHODS: Fifty young and healthy individuals were randomly assigned to a 
creatine group (n = 25) or a placebo group (n = 25). Three exercise sessions 
were carried out, with one week of rest between them. In the first week, a 
progressive load BP test was performed until the individuals reached the one 
repetition maximum (1RM) in order to for us obtain the load-to-velocity ratio of 
each participant. In the second week, the participants conducted a three-set BP 
exercise protocol against 70% 1RM, where they performed the maximum number of 
repetitions (MNR) until muscle failure occurred, with two minutes of rest 
between the sets. After one week, and following a supplementation period of 7 
days, where half of the participants consumed 0.3 g·kg-1·day-1 of creatine 
monohydrate (CR) and the other half consumed 0.3 g·kg-1·day-1 of placebo (PLA, 
maltodextrin), the protocol from the second week was repeated. After each set, 
and up to 20 min after finishing the exercise, the blood lactate concentrations 
and mean propulsive velocity (MPV) at 1 m·s-1 were measured.
RESULTS: The CR group performed a significantly higher number of repetitions in 
Set 1 (CR = 14.8 repetitions, PLA = 13.6 repetitions, p = 0.006) and Set 2 (CR = 
8 repetitions, PLA = 6.7 repetitions, p = 0.006) after supplementation, whereas 
no significant differences were seen in Set 3 (CR = 5.3 repetitions, PLA = 4.7 
repetitions, p = 0.176). However, there was a significant increase in blood 
lactate at minute 10 (p = 0.003), minute 15 (p = 0.020), and minute 20 (p = 
0.015) after the exercise in the post-supplementation period. Similarly, a 
significant increase was observed in the MPV at 1 m·s-1 in the CR group with 
respect to the PLA group at 10, 15, and 20 min after the exercise.
CONCLUSIONS: Although the creatine supplementation improved the performance in 
the strength test of muscle failure, the metabolic stress and muscle fatigue 
values were greater during the 20 min of recovery.

Younger broiler breeder flocks produce smaller eggs containing smaller yolks, 
with potentially lower energy reserves for the developing chick. Creatine is a 
naturally occurring energy source and is abundant in metabolically active 
tissues; providing this to chicks in ovo should provide additional energy to 
improve hatchability and post-hatch growth. Thus, post-hatch performance of male 
and female chicks hatched from younger breeder flocks supplemented with creatine 
monohydrate (CrM) in ovo was investigated. Four hundred eggs from Ross 308 
breeder hens aged 27 to 29 wk were collected and at d 14 assigned to a treatment 
group and received 1) no injection, 2) 0.75% saline injection, or 3) 8.16 mg 
creatine monohydrate in 0.75% saline. At hatch 72 birds (24/treatment) were 
euthanized and BW, breast muscle, heart and liver weight were obtained, and 
breast muscle tissue was placed in 10% buffered formalin. Birds were then placed 
in raised metal pens (24 pens; 10-11 birds/pen; 8 replicates/treatment) and 
grown to d 42 with BW and pen feed intake measured once a week. At d 42, 
ninty-six birds were euthanized (2 male and 2 female/pen) and the process 
occurred as at hatch. Body composition was obtained for 48 birds (2/pen; 1 
male,1 female) with a dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) scanner. Breast 
muscle tissue was processed for histological analysis and breast muscle fiber 
parameters were analyzed by ImageJ. While not statistically significant, the CrM 
treatment group saw an improved hatch rate (CrM: 93.5%, Saline: 88.6%, Control: 
88.8%) and reduced early post hatch mortality. Chicks given in ovo CrM had 
significantly increased creatine concentrations in both liver and heart tissue 
at hatch compared to those in the saline and control groups. BW, BW gain, and 
final body composition parameters were not statistically different between 
treatments and in ovo CrM did not affect breast muscle fiber number or area. The 
creatine injection likely improved the energy status of the growing embryo 
resulting in the improved hatch rate but leaving little reserves for post-hatch 
growth.

This study examined the effects of creatine (Cr) loading on body mass (BM) and 
fluid markers of total body water (TBW), extra-cellular fluid (ECF), and 
intra-cellular fluid (ICF) across the menstrual cycle (MC). Thirty moderately 
active females, either naturally-menstruating (NM) or using hormonal 
contraceptives (HC), were randomized to Cr (Cr; 4 × 5 g/day of creatine 
monohydrate for 5 days; n = 15) or a non-caloric placebo (PL; n = 15) using a 
double-blind, placebo-controlled design, with a menstrual phase crossover. BM, 
TBW, ECF, and ICF were measured at pre- and post-supplementation in randomized 
order of follicular phase (FP; NM: MC days 0−8, HC: inactive pill days) or 
luteal phase (LP; NM: ≤15 days from next projected cycle start date, HC: active 
pill days) using bioelectrical impedance spectroscopy. Acute hydration status 
and salivary estrogen were used as covariates. Change in BM was not different 
between groups across MC ([PL-Cr] Δ 0.40 ± 0.50 kg; p = 0.427) or between MC 
phase across groups ([FP-LP] Δ 0.31 ± 0.48 kg; p = 0.528). TBW (p = 0.802), ECF 
(p = 0.373), and ICF (p = 0.795) were not different between supplement groups at 
pre-supplementation/FP time points. There were no significant differences 
between the NM and HC subjects at any time point, for any outcome (p > 0.05). 
Following LP supplementation, significant changes were observed in TBW (Cr: Δ 
0.83 ± 0.38 L, PL: Δ −0.62 ± 0.38 L; p = 0.021), ECF (Cr: Δ 0.46 ± 0.15 L, PL: Δ 
−0.19 ± 0.15 L; p = 0.013), and ICF (Cr: Δ 0.74 ± 0.23 L, PL: Δ −0.02 ± 0.23 L; 
p = 0.041). These data demonstrate an increase in all fluid compartments in the 
LP following Cr loading, without observed alterations in body weight for 
females.

BACKGROUND: The association between diet, symptoms and health related quality of 
life in children and young people with Juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) is 
not clearly understood. The objectives of this systematic review and 
meta-analysis were to explore the evidence for a relationship between 
nutritional status, dietary intake, arthritis symptoms, disease activity and 
health-related quality of life in children and young people with JIA considering 
both observational and interventional studies separately.
METHOD: The databases PubMed, CINAHL, PsycINFO, Web of Science and Cochrane were 
searched in October 2019, updated in September 2020 and October 2021. Searches 
were restricted to English language, human and age (2-18 years old). Studies 
were included if they measured the effect of dietary supplements, vitamins or 
minerals, or diet in general, on quality of life and/ or arthritis symptom 
management. Two researchers independently screened titles and abstracts. Full 
texts were sourced for relevant articles. PRISMA guidelines were used for 
extracting data. For variables (vitamin D and disease activity), a 
random-effects meta-analysis model was performed. Two authors using a 
standardized data extraction form, extracted data independently.
RESULTS: 11,793 papers were identified through database searching, 26 studies 
met our inclusion criteria with 1621 participants. Overall studies quality were 
fair to good. Results from controlled trial and case control studies with total 
146 JIA patients, found that Ɯ-3 PUFA improved the mean active joint count 
(p < 0.001), Juvenile Arthritis Disease Activity Score (JADAS-27) (p < 0.001) 
and immune system (≤ 0.05). Furthermore, n-3 and n-6 PUFAs have a negative 
correlation with CRP (C-reactive protein) and ESR (erythrocyte sedimentation 
rate) (p < 0.05). Improvement in JIA symptoms were observed in one case, one 
pilot and one exploratory study with overall 9 JIA patients after receiving 
Exclusive Enteral Nutrition (EEN) which contains protein and what is required 
for a complete nutrition, A clinical trial study found Kre-Celazine nutrition 
(composed of a proprietary alkali buffered, creatine monohydrate and fatty acids 
mixture) in 16 JIA patients improved symptoms of JIA. No association was found 
between vitamin D and disease activity from three studies. Height and weight 
values in relation to healthy controls varied across studies (p = 0.029).
CONCLUSIONS: We were only able to include small studies, of lower design 
hierarchy, mainly pilot studies. We found some evidence of lower height and 
weight across studies in JIA, but were unable to confirm an association between 
diet, symptoms and health-related quality of life in children and young people 
with JIA. Well-designed, carefully measured and controlled interventional 
studies of dietary patterns in combination with important contributing factors 
such as medication and lifestyle behaviours, including physical activity, are 
required to determine the impact of diet in improving symptoms and growth 
patterns in children and young people with JIA, with an aim to improve the 
quality of their life.

BACKGROUND: Use of appearance- and performance-enhancing drugs and substances 
(APEDS) is common among adolescent and young adults. Many APEDS are legally sold 
"over-the-counter," however research has documented contamination of legal APEDS 
and many adverse effects of use. Despite this, little research has been 
conducted on legal APEDS use in Canada, particularly regarding the prevalence 
and sociodemographic predictors of use, which was the aim of this study.
METHODS: Data from the Canadian Study of Adolescent Health Behaviors (N = 2,731) 
were analyzed. Prevalence and frequency of use of 10 common APEDS in the past 
12 months were estimated overall and across genders. Multiple modified Poisson 
regression analyses were conducted to determine the sociodemographic predictors 
of APEDS use.
RESULTS: Overall, use of caffeine was most common among the sample (71.3%), 
along with protein bars (63.4%), and whey protein powders or protein shakes 
(63.1%). Boys and men reported greater prevalence of use of eight of the 10 
APEDS, with the exception of diuretics or water pills and probiotics, compared 
to girls and women and transgender/gender non-confirming participants. Over 
three quarters (82.5%) of boys and men reported use of whey protein powders or 
protein shakes and 50.3% reported use of creatine monohydrate. Use of APEDS 
varied based on several key sociodemographic identifiers.
CONCLUSIONS: This study is the first to document legal APEDS use among a sample 
of Canadian adolescents and young adults, providing important implications for

Creatine monohydrate (CM) is an established and effective dietary supplement, 
but it is not the only form of creatine. We analyzed forms of creatine for sale 
on Amazon.com" title = "http://Amazon.com">Amazon.com and evaluated if the 
advertised claims are supported by the available scientific evidence. We also 
analyzed the cost per gram of the forms of creatine. A total of 175 creatine 
supplements were included and we reported the total creatine content per 
serving, form(s) of creatine in products, product claims, and prevalence of 
products third party certified. The identified products contained 16 forms of 
creatine other than CM. The prevalence of products containing functional 
ingredients with CM or forms of creatine was 29.7%, and the prevalence of 
products containing blends of different forms of creatine was 21.7%. Only 8% of 
products were third party certified. The products using only CM (n = 91) had a 
mean price per gram of $0.12 ± 0.08, whereas products using only other forms of 
creatine (n = 32) had a mean price per gram of $0.26 ± 0.17. Approximately 88% 
of alternative creatine products in this study are classified as having limited 
to no evidence to support bioavailability, efficacy, and safety.

BACKGROUND: Limited research is available on the potential impact of creatine 
monohydrate administration before or after workouts among athletes. This study 
aimed to investigate the effects of pre- vs. post-exercise creatine monohydrate 
supplementation on resistance training adaptations and body composition.
METHODS: In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel design, 34 
healthy resistance-trained male and female athletes were randomly assigned and 
matched according to fat free mass to consume a placebo, or 5-g dose of creatine 
monohydrate within 1 h before training, or within 1 h after training for 8 
weeks, while completing a weekly resistance training program. Participants 
co-ingested 25-gram doses of both whey protein isolate and maltodextrin along 
with each assigned supplement dose. Body composition, muscular strength, and 
endurance, along with isometric mid-thigh pull were assessed before and after 
the 8-week supplementation period. A 3 × 2 mixed factorial (group x time) ANOVA 
with repeated measures on time were used to evaluate differences.
RESULTS: All groups experienced similar and statistically significant increases 
in fat free mass (+1.34 ± 3.48 kg, p = 0.04), upper (+2.21 ± 5.69 kg, p = 0.04) 
and lower body strength (+7.32 ± 10.01 kg, p < 0.001), and decreases in body 
mass (-1.09 ± 2.71 kg, p = 0.03), fat mass (-2.64 ± 4.16 kg, p = 0.001), and 
percent body fat (-2.85 ± 4.39 kg, p < 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: The timing of creatine monohydrate did not exert any additional 
influence over the measured outcomes.

AIMS: This work investigated the effects of creatine supplementation on 
different pathways related to the pathogenesis of non-alcoholic fatty liver 
disease and alcoholic liver disease.
MAIN METHODS: To induce alcoholic liver disease, male Swiss mice were divided 
into three groups: control, ethanol and ethanol supplemented with creatine. To 
induce non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, mice were divided into three groups: 
control, high-fat diet and high-fat diet supplemented with creatine. Each group 
consisted of eight animals. In both cases, creatine monohydrate was added to the 
diets (1 %; weight/vol).
KEY FINDINGS: Creatine supplementation prevented high-fat diet-induced 
non-alcoholic fatty liver disease progression, demonstrated by attenuated liver 
fat accumulation and liver damage. On the other hand, when combined with 
ethanol, creatine supplementation up-regulated key genes related to ethanol 
metabolism, oxidative stress, inflammation and lipid synthesis, and exacerbated 
ethanol-induced liver steatosis and damage, demonstrated by increased liver fat 
accumulation and histopathological score, as well as elevated oxidative damage 
markers and inflammatory mediators.
SIGNIFICANCE: Our results clearly demonstrated creatine supplementation exerts 
different outcomes in relation to non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and 
alcoholic liver disease, namely it protects against high-fat diet-induced 
non-alcoholic fatty liver disease but exacerbates ethanol-induced alcoholic 
liver disease. The exacerbating effects of the creatine and ethanol combination 
appear to be related to oxidative stress and inflammation-mediated up-regulation 
of ethanol metabolism.

Effect of creatine supplementation on kidney stones recurrence in an athlete: a 
case report.

Akbari HA, Ghram A, Knechtle B, Weiss K, Ben Saad H.

INTRODUCTION: Several studies examined the effects of creatine monohydrate 
supplementation on renal function, but no previous study has investigated its 
effects on kidney stones in humans.
OBSERVATION: A renal ultrasound in a healthy young athlete (without a known 
renal morphological anomaly, normal kidney function, normal phospholipid and 
uric acid data) revealed a kidney stone of 11 mm in the lower right calyx. 
Extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy was applied in order to break the down 
stone. Twentyone days later, a follow-up renal ultrasound showed the absence of 
stones in the kidney. One week later, the athlete started creatine monohydrate 
supplementation for two months. Fourteen months after stopping creatine 
monohydrate supplementation, a third renal ultrasound confirmed the absence of 
stones in the kidney.
CONCLUSION: Two months of creatine monohydrate supplementation in an athlete 
with a history of kidney stones could not be associated with kidney stone 
recurrence in the long run.

Introduction. Plusieurs études ont examiné les effets de la supplémentation en 
créatine monohydrate sur la fonction rénale, mais aucune étude n'a évalué ses 
effets sur les calculs rénaux chez l'homme. Observation. Une échographie rénale 
chez un jeune athlète en bonne santé (sans anomalie morphologique rénale connue, 
fonction rénale normale, bilan phospholipidique normal, acide urique normal) a 
révélé un calcul rénal de 11 mm dans le calice inférieur droit. Une lithotripsie 
extracorporelle par ondes de choc a été appliquée afin de briser le calcul. 
Vingt et un jours plus tard, une échographie rénale de suivi a montré l'absence 
de calculs dans le rein. Une semaine plus tard, l'athlète a commencé une 
supplémentation en créatine monohydrate pendant deux mois. Quatorze mois après 
l'arrêt de la supplémentation en créatine monohydrate, une troisième échographie 
rénale a confirmé l'absence de calculs dans le rein. Conclusion. Deux mois de 
supplémentation en créatine monohydrate chez un athlète ayant des antécédents de 
calculs rénaux n'ont pas pu être associés à la récurrence des calculs rénaux à 
long terme.

Stress is a common problem diminishing the muscle development of broilers. 
Creatine (Cr), an energy buffer in skeletal muscle, plays a fundamental role in 
muscle physiology. This study aimed to evaluate the effect of Cr monohydrate 
(CMH) on protein breakdown in chicken myotubes challenged by corticosterone 
(CORT) in vitro. The morphology of myotube was measured and the activation of 
ubiquitin proteasome (UP) pathway was determined. The result showed that CORT 
treatment decreased myotube diameter (P < 0.05), increased 3-methyl-histidine 
(3M-His) content in medium, enhanced the mRNA expression levels of muscle ring 
finger1(MuRF1) and Atrogin1 (P < 0.001), and Atrogin1 protein level (P < 0.05) 
compared with control. By contrast, CMH increased myotube diameter (P < 0.05) 
and myosin heavy chain (MHC) expression (P < 0.001), whereas decreased 3M-His 
and the mRNA and protein levels of Atrogin1 (P < 0.05), compared to control. In 
the present of CMH, the decreased myotube diameter and increased 3M-His, mRNA 
levels of MuRF1 and Atrogin1, and Atrogin1 protein level by CORT were partially 
relieved (P < 0.05). Hence, the result suggests that CMH alleviates CORT-induced 
protein breakdown by suppressing Atrogin1 expression in chicken myotubes. The 
result highlights the potential application of CMH in regulating muscle protein 
catabolism in chickens under stress.

Li, J, Davies, TB, and Hackett, DA. Self-reported training and supplementation 
practices between performance-enhancing drug-user bodybuilders compared with 
natural bodybuilders. J Strength Cond Res 37(5): 1079-1088, 2023-This study 
aimed to examine whether the training and supplementation practices differ 
between performance-enhancing drug (PED)-using bodybuilders (BB) and natural BB. 
One hundred eighty-seven competitive male bodybuilders with a median age of 27.0 
years completed an online survey. Of this sample, 40 respondents reported using 
PED (PED-user) and 147 respondents reported to be natural. Compared with natural 
BB, PED-user BB reported greater off-season body weight ( p < 0.001) and weight 
loss before a competition ( p < 0.001). In the off-season, PED-user BB performed 
a greater number of exercises per muscle group ( p < 0.001), number of 
repetition maximum (RM) per set ( p < 0.01), and less recovery between the sets 
( p < 0.01). During the precompetition phase, the natural BB increased their 
number of RM; however, the PED-user BB still reported using a greater number of 
RM per set ( p = 0.02), exercises per muscle group ( p < 0.001), and less 
recovery time between the sets ( p < 0.01). Both the PED-user BB and natural BB 
reported greater aerobic exercise frequency ( p < 0.001) and session duration ( 
p < 0.001), although PED-user BB performed a greater number of aerobic exercise 
sessions ( p = 0.04) and at a higher intensity ( p < 0.01). Advanced training 
techniques, including negatives, partial repetitions, preexhaustion sets, and 
timed repetitions, were more popular among PED-user BB ( p < 0.05). Creatine 
monohydrate usage was more popular among natural BB ( p < 0.001), whereas 
branched-chain and essential amino acids were more popular among PED-user BB ( p 
≤ 0.001). Findings suggest that PED-user BB perform more metabolically demanding 
resistance training sessions, more strenuous aerobic training during the 
precompetition phase, and may have different supplementation preferences 
compared with natural BB.

OBJECTIVES: Dietary supplementation combined with exercise may potentiate the 
beneficial effects of exercise by reducing exercise-induced oxidative stress and 
improving mitochondrial quality and capacity. In this study, the effects of 
creatine monohydrate (CrM) supplementation with low and high-intensity exercise 
on mitochondrial biogenesis regulators, Nrf2 anti-oxidant signaling pathway and 
muscle damage levels were investigated.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Balb/c male mice were divided into six experimental 
groups: control, control+CrM, high-intensity exercise, high-intensity 
exercise+CrM, low-intensity exercise, and low-intensity exercise+CrM. Mice were 
given CrM supplementation and at the same time, low and high-intensity exercise 
was applied to the groups on the treadmill at 30min/5day/8week. Then, 
mitochondrial biogenesis marker (PGC-1α, NRF-1, TFAM), Nrf2 and HO-1 protein 
expressions, total oxidant-anti-oxidant status level, and histopathological 
changes were investigated in serum and muscle tissue.
RESULTS: Exercise intensity and CrM supplementation were found to be effective 
factors in mitochondrial biogenesis induction via the PGC-1α signaling pathway. 
Nrf2 and HO-1 protein levels increased with exercise intensity, and this result 
was directly related to serum oxidative stress markers. In addition, CrM 
supplementation was effective in reducing exercise-induced muscle damage.
CONCLUSION: This combination induced skeletal muscle adaptations, including 
mitochondrial biogenesis and enhanced anti-oxidant reserves. This synergistic 
effect of dietary supplementation with low-intensity exercise may be valuable as 
a complement to treatment, especially in diseases caused by mitochondrial 
dysfunction.

The current investigation was conducted to test the potential effects of in ovo 
feeding of creatine monohydrate (CMH) on hatchability, embryonic mortality, 
hatching weight, and development of heart and gastrointestinal tract (main 
organs and regions) of breeder chick embryos. Rhode Island Red fertile eggs were 
randomly distributed into seven experimental treatments: untreated egg 
(control), a sterile buffered solution (0.50% NaCl), and five solutions 
containing increased levels of CMH (0.50, 1.00, 1.50, and 2.00%) + 0.50% NaCl, 
being separated in four groups/replicates (three with 15 eggs and one with 16 
eggs), totaling 61 eggs/treatment and a total of 427 fertile eggs used. All-in 
ovo injected groups with CMH decreased the hatchability and increased the 
intermediary embryonic mortality. At hatching, all-in ovo injected groups with 
CMH also increased the hatching weight and stimulated the development of the 
heart and the total length of the gastrointestinal tract, especially important 
organs for digestion of nutrients (yolk sac, pro-ventricle and gizzard) and 
regions for nutrient absorption (jejunum + ileum and colon + rectum). 
Conclusively, the in ovo feeding using CMH showed positive impacts on hatching 
weight and the development of gastrointestinal tract of chicks. However, caused 
negative impacts on hatchability.

Creatine (Cr) supplementation is a well-established strategy to enhance gains in 
strength, lean body mass, and power from a period of resistance training. 
However, the effectiveness of creatyl-L-leucine (CLL), a purported Cr amide, is 
unknown. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to assess the effects of CLL 
on muscle Cr content. Twenty-nine healthy men (n = 17) and women (n = 12) 
consumed 5 g/day of either Cr monohydrate (n = 8; 28.5 ± 7.3 years, 172.1 ± 
11.0 cm, 76.6 ± 10.7 kg), CLL (n = 11; 29.2 ± 9.3 years, 170.3 ± 10.5 cm, 71.9 ± 
14.5 kg), or placebo (n = 10; 30.3 ± 6.9 years, 167.8 ± 9.9 cm, 69.9 ± 11.1 kg) 
for 14 days in a randomized, double-blind design. Participants completed three 
bouts of supervised resistance exercise per week. Muscle biopsies were collected 
before and after the intervention for quantification of muscle Cr. Cr 
monohydrate supplementation which significantly increased muscle Cr content with 
14 days of supplementation. No changes in muscle Cr were observed for the 
placebo or CLL groups. Cr monohydrate supplementation is an effective strategy 
to augment muscle Cr content while CLL is not.

subjects: a systematic review. J Strength Cond Res 36(9): 2663-2670, 2022-Novel 
forms of creatine have appeared in the marketplace with substantial claims of 
improved efficacy compared to creatine monohydrate (CrM). The purpose of this 
study was to conduct a systematic review on alternative forms of creatine to 
determine (a) whether they are effective ergogenic aids and (b) whether they 
outperform CrM. A separate comparison was conducted to determine average cost of 
various forms of creatine. Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials 
(CENTRAL), PubMed, Medline, and Google Scholar were systematically reviewed 
according to PRISMA guidelines. The design of the review was set to answer the 
PICOS model (subjects, interventions, comparators, outcomes, and study design). 
Seventeen randomized placebo controlled clinical trials examining exercise 
performance outcomes and body composition were included in the analysis. 
Magnesium-creatine chelate and creatine citrate, malate, ethyl ester, nitrate, 
and pyruvate were the only forms researched in the literature. Of these studies, 
only 3 studies compared the alternative creatine form to CrM, making it 
difficult to compare efficacy to CrM. There were no consistent findings of 
performance enhancement among alternative forms of creatine when compared to 
placebo. A review of the marketplace shows that CrM is the lowest cost form of 
creatine. Due to the paucity of studies on alternative forms of creatine as well 
as high prices on the market of these alternative forms, CrM remains as the most 
extensively studied form of creatine that shows efficacy, safety, and lowest 
cost to consumer.

CONTEXT: From an energy perspective, the brain is very metabolically demanding. 
It is well documented that creatine plays a key role in brain bioenergetics. 
There is some evidence that creatine supplementation can augment brain creatine 
stores, which could increase memory.
OBJECTIVE: A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials 
(RCTs) was conducted to determine the effects of creatine supplementation on 
memory performance in healthy humans.
DATA SOURCES: The literature was searched through the PubMed, Web of Science, 
Cochrane Library, and Scopus databases from inception until September 2021.
DATA EXTRACTION: Twenty-three eligible RCTs were initially identified. Ten RCTs 
examining the effect of creatine supplementation compared with placebo on 
measures of memory in healthy individuals met the inclusion criteria for 
systematic review, 8 of which were included in the meta-analysis.
DATA ANALYSIS: Overall, creatine supplementation improved measures of memory 
compared with placebo (standard mean difference [SMD] = 0.29, 95%CI, 0.04-0.53; 
I2 = 66%; P = 0.02). Subgroup analyses revealed a significant improvement in 
memory in older adults (66-76 years) (SMD = 0.88; 95%CI, 0.22-1.55; I2 = 83%; 
P = 0.009) compared with their younger counterparts (11-31 years) (SMD = 0.03; 
95%CI, -0.14 to 0.20; I2 = 0%; P = 0.72). Creatine dose (≈ 2.2-20 g/d), duration 
of intervention (5 days to 24 weeks), sex, or geographical origin did not 
influence the findings.
CONCLUSION: Creatine supplementation enhanced measures of memory performance in 
healthy individuals, especially in older adults (66-76 years).

BACKGROUND: Creatine monohydrate (CrM) supplementation has been shown to be an 
effective and safe nutritional supplement to improve performance; however, the 
impact of CrM supplementation in young basketball players is less clear. This 
study evaluated the effects of CrM supplementation during a strength and 
conditioning training (SCT) program on lower-limb strength parameters and 
performance in under-16 (U16) basketball players.
METHODS: Twenty-three male U16 basketball players participated in this study 
(14.3 ± 0.4 years; BMI: 20.7 ± 2.2 kg∙m-2). The players were randomly assigned 
to either a CrM group (n = 12) that ingested 0.1 g·kg-1·day-1 of CrM or to a 
non-supplemented control group (n = 11, CON). The athletes participated in an 
8-week SCT program consisting of two lower-limb resistance-training sessions and 
two plyometric sessions per week. Squat jump (SJ), drop jump (DP), 
countermovement jump (CMJ), and Abalakov (ABK) jump power tests as well as 
basketball performance (points and minutes per game) were measured before, 
during and/or after the intervention. Data were analyzed using a general linear 
model with repeated measures with independent Student's t-test pairwise 
comparisons.
RESULTS: The results (95% confidence interval for mean change from baseline) 
show that there were significant differences for all variables for CrM and CON, 
respectively: SJ (cm): 2.6 - 6.4, P < 0.01 and 2.2-5.1 P < 0.01; DJ (cm): 
2.5-5.6, P < 0.01, and 1.8-4.4, P < 0.01; CMJ (cm): 0.3-0.8, P < 0.01, and 
0.2-0.5, P < 0.01; ABK (cm): 2.8-5.5, P < 0.01 and 0.7-2.6, P = 0.003. A 
significant group x time interaction (p = 0.003, ηp 2 = 0.342) was observed in 
ABK performance. No significant group x time effects were seen in squat jump (p 
= 0.449, ηp 2 = 0.028), drop jump (p = 0.143, ηp 2 = 0.099), or counter movement 
jump (p = 0.304, ηp 2 = 0.05). A significant interaction effect was also 
observed in points per game (p = 0.049, ηp 2 = 0.149), while a non-significant 
but medium effect was seen in minutes per game (p = 0.166, ηp 2 = 0.094).
CONCLUSIONS: CrM supplementation in conjunction with resistance and plyometric 
training increased the lower-limb ABK power and scoring performance in U16 
basketball players.

This position stand aims to provide an evidence-based summary of the energy and 
nutritional demands of tactical athletes to promote optimal health and 
performance while keeping in mind the unique challenges faced due to work 
schedules, job demands, and austere environments. After a critical analysis of 
the literature, the following nutritional guidelines represent the position of 
the International Society of Sports Nutrition (ISSN).
GENERAL RECOMMENDATIONS: Nutritional considerations should include the provision 
and timing of adequate calories, macronutrients, and fluid to meet daily needs 
as well as strategic nutritional supplementation to improve physical, cognitive, 
and occupational performance outcomes; reduce risk of injury, obesity, and 
cardiometabolic disease; reduce the potential for a fatal mistake; and promote 
occupational readiness.
MILITARY RECOMMENDATIONS: Energy demands should be met by utilizing the Military 
Dietary Reference Intakes (MDRIs) established and codified in Army Regulation 
40-25. Although research is somewhat limited, military personnel may also 
benefit from caffeine, creatine monohydrate, essential amino acids, protein, 
omega-3-fatty acids, beta-alanine, and L-tyrosine supplementation, especially 
during high-stress conditions.
FIRST RESPONDER RECOMMENDATIONS: Specific energy needs are unknown and may vary 
depending on occupation-specific tasks. It is likely the general caloric intake 
and macronutrient guidelines for recreational athletes or the Acceptable 
Macronutrient Distribution Ranges for the general healthy adult population may 
benefit first responders. Strategies such as implementing wellness policies, 
setting up supportive food environments, encouraging healthier food systems, and 
using community resources to offer evidence-based nutrition classes are 
inexpensive and potentially meaningful ways to improve physical activity and 
diet habits. The following provides a more detailed overview of the literature 
and recommendations for these populations.

Sarcopenia refers to the age-related reduction in strength, muscle mass and 
functionality which increases the risk for falls, injuries and fractures. 
Sarcopenia is associated with other age-related conditions such as osteoporosis, 
frailty and cachexia. Identifying treatments to overcome sarcopenia and 
associated conditions is important from a global health perspective. There is 
evidence that creatine monohydrate supplementation, primarily when combined with 
resistance training, has favorable effects on indices of aging muscle and bone. 
These musculoskeletal benefits provide some rationale for creatine being a 
potential intervention for treating frailty and cachexia. The purposes of this 
narrative review are to update the collective body of research pertaining to the 
effects of creatine supplementation on indices of aging muscle and bone 
(including bone turnover markers) and present possible justification and 
rationale for its utilization in the treatment of frailty and cachexia in older 
adults.

The purpose of this study was to determine the relative pharmacokinetics of 
creatine monohydrate delivered as a formula or as a pure powder (all mixed in 
solution). A single 5 g bolus of creatine monohydrate was ingested as CreaBev 1, 
CreaBev 2, or creatine monohydrate. Participants we assigned a test product and 
monitored in a supervised laboratory setting for ingestion and all blood draws 
starting 30 min post-ingestion to the 6-h mark. Standard pharmacokinetic 
analysis was undertaken to determine relative maximum concentration (Cmax), time 
to maximum concentration (Tmax), and area under the curve (AUC) for the 
products. Cmax data indicate that CreaBev 1 10.55±4.10, CreaBev 2 15.45±5.48, 
and creatine monohydrate 12.77±4.0 nmol/h/μL. The Tmax analysis demonstrated 
CreaBev 1 1.20±1.01, CreaBev 2 1.23±0.65, and creatine monohydrate 0.91±0.2 h. 
The AUC data indicate that CreaBev 1 22.90±9.17, CreaBev 2 33.92±9.52, and 
creatine monohydrate 29.58±11.93 nmol/h/μL. When examining the data for 
pharmacokinetics, the AUC and Cmax pharmacokinetics were greatest for CreaBev 2 
(p<0.021 and 0.020). Within the confines of this study, CreaBev 2 produced the 
highest blood concentrations of creatine as compared to creatine monohydrate and 
CreaBev 1.

Prophylactic creatine treatment may reduce hypoxic brain injury due to its 
ability to sustain intracellular ATP levels thereby reducing oxidative and 
metabolic stress responses during oxygen deprivation. Using microdialysis, we 
investigated the real-time in vivo effects of fetal creatine supplementation on 
cerebral metabolism following acute in utero hypoxia caused by umbilical cord 
occlusion (UCO). Fetal sheep (118 days' gestational age (dGA)) were implanted 
with an inflatable Silastic cuff around the umbilical cord and a microdialysis 
probe inserted into the right cerebral hemisphere for interstitial fluid 
sampling. Creatine (6 mg kg-1  h-1 ) or saline was continuously infused 
intravenously from 122 dGA. At 131 dGA, a 10 min UCO was induced. Hourly 
microdialysis samples were obtained from -24 to 72 h post-UCO and analysed for 
percentage change of hydroxyl radicals (• OH) and interstitial metabolites 
(lactate, pyruvate, glutamate, glycerol, glycine). Histochemical markers of 
protein and lipid oxidation were assessed at post-mortem 72 h post-UCO. Prior to 
UCO, creatine treatment reduced pyruvate and glycerol concentrations in the 
microdialysate outflow. Creatine treatment reduced interstitial cerebral • OH 
outflow 0 to 24 h post-UCO. Fetuses with higher arterial creatine concentrations 
before UCO presented with reduced levels of hypoxaemia ( PO2 and SO2 ) during 
UCO which associated with reduced interstitial cerebral pyruvate, lactate and • 
OH accumulation. No effects of creatine treatment on immunohistochemical markers 
of oxidative stress were found. In conclusion, fetal creatine treatment 
decreased cerebral outflow of • OH and was associated with an improvement in 
cerebral bioenergetics following acute hypoxia. KEY POINTS: Fetal hypoxia can 
cause persistent metabolic and oxidative stress responses that disturb energy 
homeostasis in the brain. Creatine in its phosphorylated form is an endogenous 
phosphagen; therefore, supplementation is a proposed prophylactic treatment for 
fetal hypoxia. Fetal sheep instrumented with a cerebral microdialysis probe were 
continuously infused with or without creatine-monohydrate for 10 days before 
induction of 10 min umbilical cord occlusion (UCO; 131 days' gestation). 
Cerebral interstitial fluid was collected up to 72 h following UCO. Prior to 
UCO, fetal creatine supplementation reduced interstitial cerebral pyruvate and 
glycerol concentrations. Fetal creatine supplementation reduced cerebral 
hydroxyl radical efflux up to 24 h post-UCO. Fetuses with higher arterial 
creatine concentrations before UCO and reduced levels of systemic hypoxaemia 
during UCO were associated with reduced cerebral interstitial pyruvate, lactate 
and • OH following UCO. Creatine supplementation leads to some improvements in 
cerebral bioenergetics following in utero acute hypoxia.

BACKGROUND & AIMS: Creatine is a dietary supplement with potential capacity to 
stimulate the phosphocreatine pathway and protein synthesis, through the 
stimulation of the PI3-K/AKT and mTOR cascade, its use in populations with 
reduced muscle preservation capacity (such as the older adults) can be an 
interesting and low-cost alternative. The aim of the present study was to 
evaluate the morphological, stereological and morphometric effects of the use of 
creatine monohydrate for 8 weeks on the renal, hepatic and muscular tissues of 
26-month-old Wistar rats.
METHODS: Twelve Wistar rats were divided into two groups of six animals each. 
Group 1 was not supplemented with creatine and received a standard diet 
consisting of water and chow. Group 2 received the same diet, but was 
supplemented with creatine monohydrate at a dose of 0.3 mg/kg of body weight 
diluted in 200 ml of drinking water for 8 weeks.
RESULTS: Supplementation reduced muscle mass loss as indicated by the perimeter 
of the perimysium (group 1: 114.6 μm; group 2: 65.2 μm) and endomysium (group 1: 
41,239.3 μm; group 2: 12,437.6 μm) compared to the non-supplemented group. In 
addition, a larger cross-sectional area was observed in group 2. No significant 
kidney or liver damage was observed in the supplemented group.
CONCLUSIONS: The use of creatine is considered safe in the animal model used, as 
this amine does not cause glomerular reductions or hepatic degeneration.

The Dietary Supplement Creatyl-l-Leucine Does Not Bioaccumulate in Muscle, Brain 
or Plasma and Is Not a Significant Bioavailable Source of Creatine.

Creatine is an important energy metabolite that is concentrated in tissues such 
as the muscles and brain. Creatine is reversibly converted to creatine phosphate 
through a reaction with ATP or ADP, which is catalyzed by the enzyme creatine 
kinase. Dietary supplementation with relatively large amounts of creatine 
monohydrate has been proven as an effective sports supplement that can enhances 
athletic performance during acute high-energy demand physical activity. Some 
side effects have been reported with creatine monohydrate supplementation, which 
have stimulated research into new potential molecules that could be used as 
supplements to potentially provide bioavailable creatine. Recently, a popular 
supplement, creatyl-l-leucine, has been proposed as a potential dietary 
ingredient that may potentially provide bioavailable creatine. This study tests 
whether creatyl-l-leucine is a bioavailable compound and determines whether it 
can furnish creatine as a dietary supplement. Rats were deprived of dietary 
creatine for a period of two weeks and then given one of three treatments: a 
control AIN-93G creatine-free diet, AIN-93G supplemented with creatine 
monohydrate or AIN-93G with an equimolar amount of creatyl-l-leucine supplement 
in the diet for one week. When compared to the control and the creatine 
monohydrate-supplemented diet, creatyl-l-leucine supplementation resulted in no 
bioaccumulation of either creatyl-l-leucine or creatine in tissue.

Creatine monohydrate (CrM) is one of the most widely used nutritional 
supplements among active individuals and athletes to improve high-intensity 
exercise performance and training adaptations. However, research suggests that 
CrM supplementation may also serve as a therapeutic tool in the management of 
some chronic and traumatic diseases. Creatine supplementation has been reported 
to improve high-energy phosphate availability as well as have antioxidative, 
neuroprotective, anti-lactatic, and calcium-homoeostatic effects. These 
characteristics may have a direct impact on mitochondrion's survival and health 
particularly during stressful conditions such as ischemia and injury. This 
narrative review discusses current scientific evidence for use or supplemental 
CrM as a therapeutic agent during conditions associated with mitochondrial 
dysfunction. Based on this analysis, it appears that CrM supplementation may 
have a role in improving cellular bioenergetics in several mitochondrial 
dysfunction-related diseases, ischemic conditions, and injury pathology and 
thereby could provide therapeutic benefit in the management of these conditions. 
However, larger clinical trials are needed to explore these potential 
therapeutic applications before definitive conclusions can be drawn.

Compounds: A Critical Review.

In 2011, we published a paper providing an overview about the bioavailability, 
efficacy, and regulatory status of creatine monohydrate (CrM), as well as other 
"novel forms" of creatine that were being marketed at the time. This paper 
concluded that no other purported form of creatine had been shown to be a more 
effective source of creatine than CrM, and that CrM was recognized by 
international regulatory authorities as safe for use in dietary supplements. 
Moreover, that most purported "forms" of creatine that were being marketed at 
the time were either less bioavailable, less effective, more expensive, and/or 
not sufficiently studied in terms of safety and/or efficacy. We also provided 
examples of several "forms" of creatine that were being marketed that were not 
bioavailable sources of creatine or less effective than CrM in comparative 
effectiveness trials. We had hoped that this paper would encourage supplement 
manufacturers to use CrM in dietary supplements given the overwhelming efficacy 
and safety profile. Alternatively, encourage them to conduct research to show 
their purported "form" of creatine was a bioavailable, effective, and safe 
source of creatine before making unsubstantiated claims of greater efficacy 
and/or safety than CrM. Unfortunately, unsupported misrepresentations about the 
effectiveness and safety of various "forms" of creatine have continued. The 
purpose of this critical review is to: (1) provide an overview of the 
physiochemical properties, bioavailability, and safety of CrM; (2) describe the 
data needed to substantiate claims that a "novel form" of creatine is a 
bioavailable, effective, and safe source of creatine; (3) examine whether other 
marketed sources of creatine are more effective sources of creatine than CrM; 
(4) provide an update about the regulatory status of CrM and other purported 
sources of creatine sold as dietary supplements; and (5) provide guidance 
regarding the type of research needed to validate that a purported "new form" of 
creatine is a bioavailable, effective and safe source of creatine for dietary 
supplements. Based on this analysis, we categorized forms of creatine that are 
being sold as dietary supplements as either having strong, some, or no evidence 
of bioavailability and safety. As will be seen, CrM continues to be the only 
source of creatine that has substantial evidence to support bioavailability, 
efficacy, and safety. Additionally, CrM is the source of creatine recommended 
explicitly by professional societies and organizations and approved for use in 
global markets as a dietary ingredient or food additive.

While the vast majority of research involving creatine supplementation has 
focused on skeletal muscle, there is a small body of accumulating research that 
has focused on creatine and the brain. Preliminary studies indicate that 
creatine supplementation (and guanidinoacetic acid; GAA) has the ability to 
increase brain creatine content in humans. Furthermore, creatine has shown some 
promise for attenuating symptoms of concussion, mild traumatic brain injury and 
depression but its effect on neurodegenerative diseases appears to be lacking. 
The purpose of this narrative review is to summarize the current body of 
research pertaining to creatine supplementation on total creatine and 
phophorylcreatine (PCr) content, explore GAA as an alternative or adjunct to 
creatine supplementation on brain creatine uptake, assess the impact of creatine 
on cognition with a focus on sleep deprivation, discuss the effects of creatine 
supplementation on a variety of neurological and mental health conditions, and 
outline recent advances on creatine supplementation as a neuroprotective 
supplement following traumatic brain injury or concussion.

BACKGROUND: Several studies have examined the effect of creatine monohydrate 
(CrM) on indirect muscle damage markers and muscle performance, although pooled 
data from several studies indicate that the benefits of CrM on recovery dynamics 
are limited.
OBJECTIVE: This systematic review and meta-analysis determined whether the 
ergogenic effects of CrM ameliorated markers of muscle damage and performance 
following muscle-damaging exercises.
METHODS: In total, 23 studies were included, consisting of 240 participants in 
the CrM group (age 23.9 ± 10.4 years, height 178 ± 5 cm, body mass 
76.9 ± 7.6 kg, females 10.4%) and 229 participants in the placebo group (age 
23.7 ± 8.5 years, height 177 ± 5 cm, body mass 77.0 ± 6.6 kg, females 10.0%). 
These studies were rated as fair to excellent following the PEDro scale. The 
outcome measures were compared between the CrM and placebo groups at 24-36 h and 
48-90 h following muscle-damaging exercises, using standardised mean differences 
(SMDs) and associated p-values via forest plots. Furthermore, sub-group analyses 
were conducted by separating studies into those that examined the effects of CrM 
as an acute training response (i.e., after one muscle-damaging exercise bout) 
and those that examined the chronic training response (i.e., examining the acute 
response after the last training session following several weeks of training).
RESULTS: According to the meta-analysis, the CrM group exhibited significantly 
lower indirect muscle damage markers (i.e., creatine kinase, lactate 
dehydrogenase, and/or myoglobin) at 48-90 h post-exercise for the acute training 
response (SMD - 1.09; p = 0.03). However, indirect muscle damage markers were 
significantly greater in the CrM group at 24 h post-exercise (SMD 0.95; 
p = 0.04) for the chronic training response. Although not significant, a large 
difference in indirect muscle damage markers was also found at 48 h 
post-exercise (SMD 1.24) for the chronic training response. The CrM group also 
showed lower inflammation for the acute training response at 24-36 h 
post-exercise and 48-90 h post-exercise with a large effect size 
(SMD - 1.38 ≤ d ≤  - 1.79). Similarly, the oxidative stress markers were lower 
for the acute training response in the CrM group at 24-36 h post-exercise and 
90 h post-exercise, with a large effect size (SMD - 1.37 and - 1.36, 
respectively). For delayed-onset muscle soreness (DOMS), the measures were lower 
for the CrM group at 24 h post-exercise with a moderate effect size (SMD - 0.66) 
as an acute training response. However, the inter-group differences for 
inflammation, oxidative stress, and DOMS were not statistically significant 
(p > 0.05).
CONCLUSION: Overall, our meta-analysis demonstrated a paradoxical effect of CrM 
supplementation post-exercise, where CrM appears to minimise exercise-induced 
muscle damage as an acute training response, although this trend is reversed as 
a chronic training response. Thus, CrM may be effective in reducing the level of 
exercise-induced muscle damage following a single bout of strenuous exercises, 
although training-induced stress could be exacerbated following long-term 
supplementation of CrM. Although long-term usage of CrM is known to enhance 
training adaptations, whether the increased level of exercise-induced muscle 
damage as a chronic training response may provide potential mechanisms to 
enhance chronic training adaptations with CrM supplementation remains to be 
confirmed.

CLINICAL CHARACTERISTICS: The creatine deficiency disorders (CDDs), inborn 
errors of creatine metabolism and transport, comprise three disorders: the 
creatine biosynthesis disorders guanidinoacetate methyltransferase (GAMT) 
deficiency and L-arginine:glycine amidinotransferase (AGAT) deficiency; and 
creatine transporter (CRTR) deficiency. Developmental delay and cognitive 
dysfunction or intellectual disability and speech-language disorder are common 
to all three CDDs. Onset of clinical manifestations of GAMT deficiency (reported 
in ~130 individuals) is between ages three months and two years; in addition to 
developmental delays, the majority of individuals have epilepsy and develop a 
behavior disorder (e.g., hyperactivity, autism, or self-injurious behavior), and 
about 30% have movement disorder. AGAT deficiency has been reported in 16 
individuals; none have had epilepsy or movement disorders. Clinical findings of 
CRTR deficiency in affected males (reported in ~130 individuals) in addition to 
developmental delays include epilepsy (variable seizure types and may be 
intractable) and behavior disorders (e.g., attention deficit and/or 
hyperactivity, autistic features, impulsivity, social anxiety), hypotonia, and 
(less commonly) a movement disorder. Poor weight gain with constipation and 
prolonged QTc on EKG have been reported. While mild-to-moderate intellectual 
disability is commonly observed up to age four years, the majority of adult 
males with CRTR deficiency have been reported to have severe intellectual 
disability. Females heterozygous for CRTR deficiency are typically either 
asymptomatic or have mild intellectual disability, although a more severe 
phenotype resembling the male phenotype has been reported.
DIAGNOSIS/TESTING: The diagnosis of a CDD is established in a proband with 
suggestive findings and biallelic pathogenic variants in GAMT or GATM or a 
hemizygous or heterozygous pathogenic variant in SLC6A8 identified by molecular 
genetic testing.
MANAGEMENT: Treatment of manifestations: GAMT deficiency and AGAT deficiency are 
treated with oral creatine monohydrate to replenish cerebral creatine levels. 
Treatment of GAMT deficiency requires supplementation of ornithine and dietary 
restriction of arginine or protein. CRTR deficiency is treated with oral 
creatine monohydrate and arginine and glycine supplementation. The developmental 
delay, intellectual disability, and behavior problems are managed with an 
individualized education and therapy program; epilepsy and movement disorder are 
treated by the appropriate specialist in a standard manner. Surveillance: In 
those treated with creatine monohydrate, periodic determination of cerebral 
creatine level by in vivo 1H-MRS and annual measurement of renal function to 
detect possible creatine-associated nephropathy is warranted. Developmental and 
neurologic assessments are recommended at each clinic visit. Evaluation of 
relatives at risk: Early diagnosis of neonates at risk for a CDD by biochemical 
or molecular genetic testing allows for early diagnosis and treatment.
GENETIC COUNSELING: GAMT deficiency (caused by pathogenic variants in GAMT) and 
AGAT deficiency (caused by pathogenic variants in GATM) are inherited in an 
autosomal recessive manner. CRTR deficiency (caused by pathogenic variants in 
SLC6A8) is inherited in an X-linked manner. Autosomal recessive inheritance. If 
both parents are known to be heterozygous for a GAMT or GATM pathogenic variant, 
each sib of an affected individual has at conception a 25% chance of being 
affected, a 50% chance of being an asymptomatic carrier, and a 25% chance of 
being unaffected and not a carrier. Once the GAMT or GATM pathogenic variants 
have been identified in an affected family member, molecular genetic carrier 
testing and prenatal and preimplantation genetic testing are possible. X-linked 
inheritance. Mothers who are heterozygous for an SLC6A8 pathogenic variant have 
a 50% chance of transmitting the pathogenic variant in each pregnancy; sons who 
inherit the pathogenic variant will be affected; daughters who inherit the 
pathogenic variant will be heterozygotes and may develop clinical findings 
related to the disorder. Once the SLC6A8 pathogenic variant has been identified 
in an affected family member, molecular genetic testing to identify female 
heterozygotes and prenatal and preimplantation genetic testing are possible.

Dermal fibroblasts provide structural support by producing collagen and other 
structural/support proteins beneath the epidermis. Fibroblasts also produce 
insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), which binds to the IGF-1 receptors 
(IGF-1Rs) on keratinocytes to activate signaling pathways that regulate cell 
proliferation and cellular responses to genotoxic stressors like ultraviolet B 
radiation. Our group has determined that the lack of IGF-1 expression due to 
fibroblast senescence in the dermis of geriatric individuals is correlated with 
an increased incidence of skin cancer. The present studies tested the hypothesis 
that pro-energetics creatine monohydrate (Cr) and nicotinamide (NAM) can protect 
normal dermal human fibroblasts (DHF) against experimentally induced senescence. 
To that end, we used an experimental model of senescence in which primary DHF 
are treated with hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) in vitro, with senescence measured by 
staining for beta-galactosidase activity, p21 protein expression, and senescence 
associated secretory phenotype cytokine mRNA levels. We also determined the 
effect of H2O2 on IGF-1 mRNA and protein expression. Our studies indicate that 
pretreatment with Cr or NAM protects DHF from the H2O2-induced cell senescence. 
Treatment with pro-energetics post-H2O2 had no effect. Moreover, these agents 
also inhibited reactive oxygen species generation from H2O2 treatment. These 
studies suggest a potential strategy for protecting fibroblasts in geriatric 
skin from undergoing stress-induced senescence, which may maintain IGF-1 levels 
and therefore limit carcinogenesis in epidermal keratinocytes.

The primary objective of this study was to investigate the potential synergy 
between low doses of L-carnitine tartrate and creatine monohydrate to induce 
muscle protein synthesis and anabolic pathway activation in primary human 
myoblasts. In addition, the effects of Lipid multi-particulates (LMP) 
formulation on creatine stability and bioavailability were assessed in rodents 
and healthy human subjects. When used individually, L-carnitine tartrate at 50 
µM and creatine monohydrate at 0.5 µM did not affect myoblast protein synthesis 
and signaling. However, when combined, they led to a significant increase in 
protein synthesis. Increased AKT and RPS6 phosphorylation were observed with 50 
µM L-carnitine tartrate 5 µM creatine in combination in primary human myoblasts. 
When Wistar rats were administered creatine with LMP formulation at either 21 or 
51 mg/kg, bioavailability was increased by 27% based on the increase in the area 
under the curve (AUC) at a 51 mg/kg dose compared to without LMP formulation. 
Tmax and Cmax were unchanged. Finally, in human subjects, a combination of LMP 
formulated L-carnitine at 500 mg (from L-carnitine tartrate) with LMP formulated 
creatine at 100, 200, or 500 mg revealed a significant and dose-dependent 
increase in plasma creatine concentrations. Serum total L-carnitine levels rose 
in a similar manner in the three combinations. These results suggest that a 
combination of low doses of L-carnitine tartrate and creatine monohydrate may 
lead to a significant and synergistic enhancement of muscle protein synthesis 
and activation of anabolic signaling. In addition, the LMP formulation of 
creatine improved its bioavailability. L-carnitine at 500 mg and LMP-formulated 
creatine at 200 or 500 mg may be useful for future clinical trials to evaluate 
the effects on muscle protein synthesis.

This study was focused on the creation of high-protein bars formulated using 
whey protein isolate (24%) and soy protein isolate (6%) as the sources of 
proteins; oat flakes and inulin, both abundant in dietary fibres, and creatine 
monohydrate and other minor ingredients (vitamin and mineral mixture, potassium 
sorbate) to achieve the requirements for a meal replacement formula for 
physically active people. The nutritional profile of the high-protein bar was 
examined (energy 1215 kJ/288 kcal; protein 34.1 ± 0.20 g, fat 6.01 ± 0.13 g of 
which was saturated 3.12 ± 0.08 g, fibre 3.10 ± 0.17 g carbohydrate 23.0 ± 0.16 
g of which sugars 1.50 ± 0.19 g and starch 21.5 ± 0.11 g in 100 g), and sensory 
properties with instrumental parameters (texture and colour) were determined and 
compared with bars commercially available on the market. The created 
high-protein bar was sensorily acceptable in comparison to other commercially 
available bars. The dietary intervention study was conducted on elite athletes 
(professional handball players) to evaluate effects of created versus control 
bar consumption on their metabolic parameters. The baseline characteristics 
(mean age, body mass index (BMI), fat mass, muscle mass, lean mass and fat 
percentage) of the athletes (8) were determined at the start of the study. The 
cross-over intervention study was organized in two successive phases (5 days 
each) with a seven-day long washout period between phases. Bars were consumed 
after the afternoon training unit. Blood samples were collected at the start and 
the end of the intervention study to analyse the metabolic profiles of the 
athletes. Serum levels of high-density cholesterol (HDL), low-density 
cholesterol (LDL) and total cholesterol (HOL), glucose, triacylglycerides (TAG), 
total and direct bilirubin, creatine kinase (CK), aspartate aminotransferase 
(AST) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) were measured. The results showed that bar 
consumption significantly decreased serum aspartate transaminase (AST) and 
lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and increased total and direct bilirubin levels, 
suggesting lower exercise-induced muscle damage and increased antioxidative 
response, respectively. Therefore, it can be concluded that the consumption of 
the created high-protein bar was able to improve physiological adaptation after 
training.

The uptake and efflux of solutes across a plasma membrane is controlled by 
transporters. There are two main superfamilies of transporters, adenosine 
5'-triphosphate (ATP) binding cassettes (ABCs) and solute carriers (SLCs). In 
the brain, SLC transporters are involved in transporting various solutes across 
the blood-brain barrier, blood-cerebrospinal fluid barrier, astrocytes, neurons, 
and other brain cell types including oligodendrocytes and microglial cells. SLCs 
play an important role in maintaining normal brain function. Hence, mutations in 
the genes that encode SLC transporters can cause a variety of neurological 
disorders. We identified the following SLC gene variants in 25 patients in our 
cohort: SLC1A2, SLC2A1, SLC5A1, SLC6A3, SLC6A5, SLC6A8, SLC9A6, SLC9A9, SLC12A6, 
SLC13A5, SLC16A1, SLC17A5, SLC19A3, SLC25A12, SLC25A15, SLC27A4, SLC45A1, 
SLC46A1, and SLC52A3. Eight patients harbored pathogenic or likely pathogenic 
mutations (SLC5A1, SLC9A6, SLC12A6, SLC16A1, SLC19A3, and SLC52A3), and 12 
patients were found to have variants of unknown clinical significance (VOUS); 
these variants occurred in 11 genes (SLC1A2, SLC2A1, SLC6A3, SLC6A5, SLC6A8, 
SLC9A6, SLC9A9, SLC13A5, SLC25A12, SLC27A4, and SLC45A1). Five patients were 
excluded as they were carriers. In the remaining 20 patients with SLC gene 
variants, we identified 16 possible distinct neurological disorders. Based on 
the clinical presentation, we categorized them into genes causing intellectual 
delay (ID) or autism spectrum disorder (ASD), those causing epilepsy, those 
causing vitamin-related disorders, and those causing other neurological 
diseases. Several variants were detected that indicated possible personalized 
therapies: SLC2A1 led to dystonia or epilepsy, which can be treated with a 
ketogenic diet; SLC6A3 led to infantile parkinsonism-dystonia 1, which can be 
treated with levodopa; SLC6A5 led to hyperekplexia 3, for which unnecessary 
treatment with antiepileptic drugs should be avoided; SLC6A8 led to creatine 
deficiency syndrome type 1, which can be treated with creatine monohydrate; 
SLC16A1 led to monocarboxylate transporter 1 deficiency, which causes seizures 
that should not be treated with a ketogenic diet; SLC19A3 led to 
biotin-thiamine-responsive basal ganglia disease, which can be treated with 
biotin and thiamine; and SLC52A3 led to Brown-Vialetto-Van-Laere syndrome 1, 
which can be treated with riboflavin. The present study examines the prevalence 
of SLC gene mutations in our cohort of children with epilepsy and other 
neurological disorders. It highlights the diverse phenotypes associated with 
mutations in this large family of SLC transporter proteins, and an opportunity 
for personalized genomics and personalized therapeutics.

This systematic review aimed to identify nutritional interventions and 
supplements that improve the performance for wheelchair athletes. Intervention 
trials involving high-performance wheelchair athletes were analyzed, including 
those that comprised a nutritional intervention, defined as any intervention 
related to food, beverages, and supplementation aiming at evaluating the 
performance of wheelchair athletes. Of the included studies, four evaluated 
caffeine supplementation, of which one also evaluated sodium citrate 
supplementation; two studies evaluated vitamin D supplementation; one study 
assessed creatine monohydrate supplementation; and one assessed carbohydrate 
supplementation. Most studies were conducted on athletes with spinal cord 
injury. Athletes who consumed caffeine exhibited an improvement in performance, 
but this finding is not strong enough to become a recommendation.

BACKGROUND: Creatine supplementation, in close proximity to resistance training 
sessions, may be an important strategy to augment muscle accretion and strength. 
The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of creatine supplementation 
immediately before compared to immediately after unilateral resistance training 
on hypertrophy and strength.
METHODS: Using a counter-balanced, double-blind, repeated measures 
within-subject design, ten recreationally active participants (7 males; 3 
females; age: 23±5 years; height: 174±9 cm; body mass: 73.5±9.7 kg) were 
randomized to supplement with creatine monohydrate (0.1 g/kg of body mass) 
immediately before and placebo immediately after training one side of the body 
and placebo immediately before and creatine immediately after training the other 
side of the body on alternate days. Resistance training consisted of elbow 
flexion and knee extension (3-6 sets at 80% 1-repetition maximum [1-RM]) for 8 
weeks. Prior to and following training, muscle thickness (elbow flexors and leg 
extensors; ultrasonography) and strength (1-RM for the elbow flexors and knee 
extensors) was assessed.
RESULTS: There was a significant increase over time for muscle thickness, 
strength, and relative strength (P<0.01), with no differences between creatine 
ingestion strategies. Total training volume performed was similar between 
conditions (P=0.56).
CONCLUSIONS: Creatine supplementation, immediately before or immediately after 
unilateral resistance training, produces similar gains in muscle hypertrophy and 
strength in young adults.

Managing the body composition of athletes is a common practice in the field of 
sports nutrition. The loss of body weight (BW) in resistance-trained athletes is 
mainly conducted for aesthetic reasons (bodybuilding) or performance 
(powerlifting or weightlifting). The aim of this review is to provide 
dietary-nutritional strategies for the loss of fat mass in resistance-trained 
athletes. During the weight loss phase, the goal is to reduce the fat mass by 
maximizing the retention of fat-free mass. In this narrative review, the 
scientific literature is evaluated, and dietary-nutritional and supplementation 
recommendations for the weight loss phase of resistance-trained athletes are 
provided. Caloric intake should be set based on a target BW loss of 
0.5-1.0%/week to maximize fat-free mass retention. Protein intake (2.2-3.0 
g/kgBW/day) should be distributed throughout the day (3-6 meals), ensuring in 
each meal an adequate amount of protein (0.40-0.55 g/kgBW/meal) and including a 
meal within 2-3 h before and after training. Carbohydrate intake should be 
adapted to the level of activity of the athlete in order to training performance 
(2-5 g/kgBW/day). Caffeine (3-6 mg/kgBW/day) and creatine monohydrate (3-5 
g/day) could be incorporated into the athlete's diet due to their ergogenic 
effects in relation to resistance training. The intake of micronutrients 
complexes should be limited to special situations in which there is a real 
deficiency, and the athlete cannot consume through their diet.

Sarcopenia, an age-related decline in skeletal muscle mass and function, 
dramatically affects the quality of life. Although there is a consensus that 
sarcopenia is a multifactorial syndrome, the etiology and underlying mechanisms 
are not yet delineated. Moreover, research about nutritional interventions to 
prevent the development of sarcopenia is mainly focused on the amount and 
quality of protein intake. The impact of several nutrition strategies that 
consider timing of food intake, anti-inflammatory nutrients, metabolic control, 
and the role of mitochondrial function on the progression of sarcopenia is not 
fully understood. This narrative review summarizes the metabolic background of 
this phenomenon and proposes an integral nutritional approach (including dietary 
supplements such as creatine monohydrate) to target potential molecular pathways 
that may affect reduce or ameliorate the adverse effects of sarcopenia. Lastly, 
miRNAs, in particular those produced by skeletal muscle (MyomiR), might 
represent a valid tool to evaluate sarcopenia progression as a potential rapid 
and early biomarker for diagnosis and characterization.

BACKGROUND: Numerous studies have demonstrated the efficacy of creatine 
supplementation for improvements in exercise performance. Few studies, however, 
have examined the effects of phosphocreatine supplementation on exercise 
performance. Furthermore, while polyphenols have antioxidant and 
anti-inflammatory properties, little is known regarding the influence of 
polyphenol supplementation on muscular strength, power, and endurance. Thus, the 
purpose of the present study was to compare the effects of 28 days of 
supplementation with phosphocreatine disodium salts plus blueberry extract 
(PCDSB), creatine monohydrate (CM), and placebo on measures of muscular 
strength, power, and endurance.
METHODS: Thirty-three men were randomly assigned to consume either PCDSB, CM, or 
placebo for 28 days. Peak torque (PT), average power (AP), and percent decline 
for peak torque (PT%) and average power (AP%) were assessed from a fatigue test 
consisting of 50 maximal, unilateral, isokinetic leg extensions at 180°·s- 1 
before and after the 28 days of supplementation. Individual responses were 
assessed to examine the proportion of subjects that exceeded a minimal important 
difference (MID).
RESULTS: The results demonstrated significant (p < 0.05) improvements in PT for 
the PCDSB and CM groups from pre- (99.90 ± 22.47 N·m and 99.95 ± 22.50 N·m, 
respectively) to post-supplementation (119.22 ± 29.87 N·m and 
111.97 ± 24.50 N·m, respectively), but no significant (p = 0.112) change for the 
placebo group. The PCDSB and CM groups also exhibited significant improvements 
in AP from pre- (140.18 ± 32.08 W and 143.42 ± 33.84 W, respectively) to 
post-supplementation (170.12 ± 42.68 W and 159.78 ± 31.20 W, respectively), but 
no significant (p = 0.279) change for the placebo group. A significantly 
(p < 0.05) greater proportion of subjects in the PCDSB group exceeded the MID 
for PT compared to the placebo group, but there were no significant (p > 0.05) 
differences in the proportion of subjects exceeding the MID between the CM and 
placebo groups or between the CM and PCDSB groups.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings indicated that for the group mean responses, 28 days 
of supplementation with both PCDSB and CM resulted in increases in PT and AP. 
The PCDSB, however, may have an advantage over CM when compared to the placebo 
group for the proportion of individuals that respond favorably to 
supplementation with meaningful increases in muscular strength.

Creatine (Cr) and phosphocreatine (PCr) are physiologically essential molecules 
for life, given they serve as rapid and localized support of energy- and 
mechanical-dependent processes. This evolutionary advantage is based on the 
action of creatine kinase (CK) isozymes that connect places of ATP synthesis 
with sites of ATP consumption (the CK/PCr system). Supplementation with creatine 
monohydrate (CrM) can enhance this system, resulting in well-known ergogenic 
effects and potential health or therapeutic benefits. In spite of our vast 
knowledge about these molecules, no integrative analysis of molecular mechanisms 
under a systems biology approach has been performed to date; thus, we aimed to 
perform for the first time a convergent functional genomics analysis to identify 
biological regulators mediating the effects of Cr supplementation in health and 
disease. A total of 35 differentially expressed genes were analyzed. We 
identified top-ranked pathways and biological processes mediating the effects of 
Cr supplementation. The impact of CrM on miRNAs merits more research. We also 
cautiously suggest two dose-response functional pathways (kinase- and 
ubiquitin-driven) for the regulation of the Cr uptake. Our functional enrichment 
analysis, the knowledge-based pathway reconstruction, and the identification of 
hub nodes provide meaningful information for future studies. This work 
contributes to a better understanding of the well-reported benefits of Cr in 
sports and its potential in health and disease conditions, although further 
clinical research is needed to validate the proposed mechanisms.

White adipose tissue (WAT) is a dynamic endocrine organ that can play a 
significant role in thermoregulation. WAT has the capacity to adopt structural 
and functional characteristics of the more metabolically active brown adipose 
tissue (BAT) and contribute to non-shivering thermogenesis under specific 
stimuli. Non-shivering thermogenesis was previously thought to be uncoupling 
protein 1 (UCP1)-dependent however, recent evidence suggests that 
UCP1-independent mechanisms of thermogenesis exist. Namely, futile creatine 
cycling has been identified as a contributor to WAT thermogenesis. The purpose 
of this study was to examine the efficacy of creatine supplementation to alter 
mitochondrial markers as well as adipocyte size and multilocularity in inguinal 
(iWAT), gonadal (gWAT), and BAT. Thirty-two male and female Sprague-Dawley rats 
were treated with varying doses (0 g/L, 2.5 g/L, 5 g/L, and 10 g/L) of creatine 
monohydrate for 8 weeks. We demonstrate that mitochondrial markers respond in a 
sex and depot specific manner. In iWAT, female rats displayed significant 
increases in COXIV, PDH-E1alpha, and cytochrome C protein content. Male rats 
exhibited gWAT specific increases in COXIV and PDH-E1alpha protein content. This 
study supports creatine supplementation as a potential method of 
UCP1-independant thermogenesis and highlights the importance of taking a 
sex-specific approach when examining the efficacy of browning therapeutics in 
future research.

Creatine monohydrate (CrM) supplementation has been shown to improve body 
composition and muscle strength when combined with resistance training (RT); 
however, no study has evaluated the combination of this nutritional strategy 
with cluster-set resistance training (CS-RT). The purpose of this pilot study 
was to evaluate the effects of CrM supplementation during a high-protein diet 
and a CS-RT program on lower-limb fat-free mass (LL-FFM) and muscular strength. 
Twenty-three resistance-trained men (>2 years of training experience, 26.6 ± 8.1 
years, 176.3 ± 6.8 cm, 75.6 ± 8.9 kg) participated in this study. Subjects were 
randomly allocated to a CS-RT+CrM (n = 8), a CS-RT (n = 8), or a control group 
(n = 7). The CS-RT+CrM group followed a CrM supplementation protocol with 0.1 
g·kg-1·day-1 over eight weeks. Two sessions per week of lower-limb CS-RT were 
performed. LL-FFM corrected for fat-free adipose tissue (dual-energy X-ray 
absorptiometry) and muscle strength (back squat 1 repetition maximum (SQ-1RM) 
and countermovement jump (CMJ)) were measured pre- and post-intervention. 
Significant improvements were found in whole-body fat mass, fat percentage, 
LL-fat mass, LL-FFM, and SQ-1RM in the CS-RT+CrM and CS-RT groups; however, 
larger effect sizes were obtained in the CS-RT+CrM group regarding whole body 
FFM (0.64 versus 0.16), lower-limb FFM (0.62 versus 0.18), and SQ-1RM (1.23 
versus 0.75) when compared to the CS-RT group. CMJ showed a significant 
improvement in the CS-RT+CrM group with no significant changes in CS-RT or 
control groups. No significant differences were found between groups. Eight 
weeks of CrM supplementation plus a high-protein diet during a CS-RT program has 
a higher clinical meaningfulness on lower-limb body composition and 
strength-related variables in trained males than CS-RT alone. Further research 
might study the potential health and therapeutic effects of this nutrition and 
exercise strategy.

BACKGROUND: Rates of major depressive disorder (MDD) increase with living at 
altitude. In our model, rats housed at moderate altitude (in hypobaric hypoxia) 
exhibit increased depression-like behavior, altered brain serotonin and a lack 
of antidepressant response to most selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors 
(SSRIs). A forebrain deficit in the bioenergetic marker creatine is noted in 
people living at altitude or with MDD.
METHODS: Rats housed at 4500 ft were given dietary creatine monohydrate (CRMH, 
4% w/w, 5 weeks) vs. un-supplemented diet, and impact on depression-like 
behavior, brain bioenergetics, serotonin and SSRI efficacy assessed.
RESULTS: CRMH significantly improved brain creatine in a sex-based manner. At 
altitude, CRMH increased serotonin levels in the female prefrontal cortex and 
striatum but reduced male striatal and hippocampal serotonin. Dietary CRMH was 
antidepressant in the forced swim test and anti-anhedonic in the sucrose 
preference test in only females at altitude, with motor behavior unchanged. CRMH 
improved fluoxetine efficacy (20 mg/kg) in only males at altitude: CRMH + SSRI 
significantly improved male striatal creatine and serotonin vs. CRMH alone.
CONCLUSIONS: Dietary CRMH exhibits sex-based efficacy in resolving 
altitude-related deficits in brain biomarkers, depression-like behavior and SSRI 
efficacy, and may be effective clinically for SSRI-resistant depression at 
altitude. This is the first study to link CRMH treatment to improving brain 
serotonin.

BACKGROUND & AIMS: Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is an X-linked 
neuromuscular condition causing progressive muscle weakness and premature death. 
Whilst effective treatments such as gene therapy are developed, families often 
seek complementary therapies such as nutrition supplements to help their son 
maintain function; however, there is limited evidence supporting the use of 
nutritional supplements in DMD. This study aimed to compare the effect of a 
Standard nutritional supplement with an Enhanced nutritional supplement 
combining three nutriceuticals on functional outcomes in ambulatory boys with 
Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD).
DESIGN: A 50-week double blinded, randomized, controlled crossover trial was 
conducted in four Australian neuromuscular centres. Primary outcome measures 
were 6-min walk distance (6MWD) and community ambulation (StepWatch™ Activity 
Monitoring). Secondary outcome measures included body composition and quality of 
life. Serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D was measured.
RESULTS: Twenty-seven boys completed the intervention. Traditional crossover 
analysis demonstrated the Enhanced supplement compared to the Standard 
supplement was associated with a difference of +12 (95% CI: -16, 40) metres in 
6MWD, +0.5 (95% CI: -53, 54) inactive minutes per day and -95 (95% CI: -887, 
696) steps per day. A mixed effect model indicated a potentially clinically 
important effect of the Enhanced supplement on the 6MWD of +31 (95% CI: -19, 81) 
metres. Mean serum 25 hydroxyvitamin D levels at week 50 was 94 (95% CI: 84, 
104) nmol/L. There was no observable effect of either supplement regime on body 
composition or quality of life.
CONCLUSIONS: Whilst a positive effect of the Enhanced supplement on functional 
outcomes was observed, this finding was inconclusive due to the small sample 
size. The results do not support the use of combined nutritional supplements to 
improve body composition or quality of life in DMD. A dose of 2000 IU vitamin D 
was an adequate dose to raise serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D over 50 weeks.

Creatine is one of the most studied and popular ergogenic aids for athletes and 
recreational weightlifters seeking to improve sport and exercise performance, 
augment exercise training adaptations, and mitigate recovery time. Studies 
consistently reveal that creatine supplementation exerts positive ergogenic 
effects on single and multiple bouts of short-duration, high-intensity exercise 
activities, in addition to potentiating exercise training adaptations. In this 
respect, supplementation consistently demonstrates the ability to enlarge the 
pool of intracellular creatine, leading to an amplification of the cell's 
ability to resynthesize adenosine triphosphate. This intracellular expansion is 
associated with several performance outcomes, including increases in maximal 
strength (low-speed strength), maximal work output, power production (high-speed 
strength), sprint performance, and fat-free mass. Additionally, creatine 
supplementation may speed up recovery time between bouts of intense exercise by 
mitigating muscle damage and promoting the faster recovery of lost 
force-production potential. Conversely, contradictory findings exist in the 
literature regarding the potential ergogenic benefits of creatine during 
intermittent and continuous endurance-type exercise, as well as in those 
athletic tasks where an increase in body mass may hinder enhanced performance. 
The purpose of this review was to summarize the existing literature surrounding 
the efficacy of creatine supplementation on exercise and sports performance, 
along with recovery factors in healthy populations.

Sprague-Dawley rats (n = 32) underwent 8-weeks of creatine monohydrate (CM) 
supplementation (0, 2.5, 5, and 10 g/L). Total creatine (TCr) concentrations in 
female white fibre-dominant gastrocnemius (WGAS) and cardiac muscle (HRT) were 
significantly higher compared with males (p < 0.05). CM supplementation 
increased TCr concentrations in female WGAS (p < 0.05) and HRT (p < 0.01) and in 
male red fibre-dominant gastrocnemius muscle (RGAS) (p < 0.05). Future research 
should further investigate sex-differences in basal levels of TCr and the 
response to CM supplementation. Novelty: There is a sex- and tissue-dependant 
response to CM supplementation in rats.

INTRODUCTION: The impact of prehabilitation remains controversial due to a short 
presurgical waiting period and the diminished capacity of the patient 
population. A strategy to augment and optimize the effectiveness of 
prehabilitations for abdominal cancer patients may be found in the unlikely 
field of sport science. We investigated the use of blood flow restriction 
training and sport nutrition supplementation to augment functional capacity and 
increase muscle strength in twenty-four abdominal cancer patients awaiting 
surgery.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The sport science-based program was comprised of blood 
flow restriction exercise 5 to 6 times per week and a daily sports nutrition 
supplement containing l-citrulline, creatine monohydrate, and whey protein.
RESULTS: After 4 weeks of prehabilitation, 6-min walk test, timed up and go, 
short physical performance battery, 5-chair stand test and physical component 
score of quality of life were significantly improved (all p < 0.05). Total body 
and appendicular lean mass as assessed by dual energy X-ray absorptiometry 
increased by 0.73 ± 1.04 kg (p = 0.004) and 0.42 ± 0.64 kg (p = 0.006), 
respectively. Total body fat mass and trunk fat mass decreased (p = 0.004 and 
p = 0.021). There were no significant changes in hand grip strength, fear of 
falling, the mental component summary of quality of life, or fasting serum 
concentrations of myostatin, follistatin, and growth hormone.
CONCLUSION: A multimodal prehabilitation program, which encompasses blood flow 
restriction training and sports nutrition supplements, is both feasible and 
effective in improving lean mass and physical function in abdominal cancer 
patients prior to surgery.

Numerous health conditions affecting the musculoskeletal, cardiopulmonary, and 
nervous systems can result in physical dysfunction, impaired performance, muscle 
weakness, and disuse-induced atrophy. Due to its well-documented anabolic 
potential, creatine monohydrate has been investigated as a supplemental agent to 
mitigate the loss of muscle mass and function in a variety of acute and chronic 
conditions. A review of the literature was conducted to assess the current state 
of knowledge regarding the effects of creatine supplementation on rehabilitation 
from immobilization and injury, neurodegenerative diseases, cardiopulmonary 
disease, and other muscular disorders. Several of the findings are encouraging, 
showcasing creatine's potential efficacy as a supplemental agent via 
preservation of muscle mass, strength, and physical function; however, the 
results are not consistent. For multiple diseases, only a few creatine studies 
with small sample sizes have been published, making it difficult to draw 
definitive conclusions. Rationale for discordant findings is further complicated 
by differences in disease pathologies, intervention protocols, creatine dosing 
and duration, and patient population. While creatine supplementation 
demonstrates promise as a therapeutic aid, more research is needed to fill gaps 
in knowledge within medical rehabilitation.

Based on theoretical considerations, experimental data with cells in vitro, 
animal studies in vivo, as well as a single case pilot study with one colitis 
patient, a consolidated hypothesis can be put forward, stating that "oral 
supplementation with creatine monohydrate (Cr), a pleiotropic cellular energy 
precursor, is likely to be effective in inducing a favorable response and/or 
remission in patients with inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), like ulcerative 
colitis and/or Crohn's disease". A current pilot clinical trial that 
incorporates the use of oral Cr at a dose of 2 × 7 g per day, over an initial 
period of 2 months in conjunction with ongoing therapies (NCT02463305) will be 
informative for the proposed larger, more long-term Cr supplementation study of 
2 × 3-5 g of Cr per day for a time of 3-6 months. This strategy should be 
insightful to the potential for Cr in reducing or alleviating the symptoms of 
IBD. Supplementation with chemically pure Cr, a natural nutritional supplement, 
is well tolerated not only by healthy subjects, but also by patients with 
diverse neuromuscular diseases. If the outcome of such a clinical pilot study 
with Cr as monotherapy or in conjunction with metformin were positive, oral Cr 
supplementation could then be used in the future as potentially useful adjuvant 
therapeutic intervention for patients with IBD, preferably together with 
standard medication used for treating patients with chronic ulcerative colitis 
and/or Crohn's disease.

Role of Creatine in the Heart: Health and Disease.

Creatine is a key player in heart contraction and energy metabolism. Creatine 
supplementation (throughout the paper, only supplementation with creatine 
monohydrate will be reviewed, as this is by far the most used and best-known way 
of supplementing creatine) increases creatine content even in the normal heart, 
and it is generally safe. In heart failure, creatine and phosphocreatine 
decrease because of decreased expression of the creatine transporter, and 
because phosphocreatine degrades to prevent adenosine triphosphate (ATP) 
exhaustion. This causes decreased contractility reserve of the myocardium and 
correlates with left ventricular ejection fraction, and it is a predictor of 
mortality. Thus, there is a strong rationale to supplement with creatine the 
failing heart. Pending additional trials, creatine supplementation in heart 
failure may be useful given data showing its effectiveness (1) against specific 
parameters of heart failure, and (2) against the decrease in muscle strength and 
endurance of heart failure patients. In heart ischemia, the majority of trials 
used phosphocreatine, whose mechanism of action is mostly unrelated to changes 
in the ergogenic creatine-phosphocreatine system. Nevertheless, preliminary data 
with creatine supplementation are encouraging, and warrant additional studies. 
Prevention of cardiac toxicity of the chemotherapy compounds anthracyclines is a 
novel field where creatine supplementation may also be useful. Creatine 
effectiveness in this case may be because anthracyclines reduce expression of 
the creatine transporter, and because of the pleiotropic antioxidant properties 
of creatine. Moreover, creatine may also reduce concomitant muscle damage by 
anthracyclines.

Strength Cond Res 35(5): 1256-1261, 2021-The purpose of this study was to 
compare the efficacy of skeletal muscle uptake of creatine monohydrate (Cr H2O) 
with that of creatine bound to polyethylene glycol (Cr PEG). Healthy men (X ± 
SE; age = 23.5 ± 1.0 years) were divided into control (Con, n = 9, 20 g·d-1 of 
Cr H2O) and experimental (Exp, n = 8, 10 g·d-1 of Cr PEG) groups. Blood samples 
and muscle biopsies were used to determine acute gastrointestinal absorption 
over 5 hours and muscle cellular uptake over 5 days. Both groups exhibited 
significantly (p < 0.05) elevated concentrations of muscle-free Cr (M·gdw-1; 
Con, pre = 23.0 ± 4.2, post = 39.2 ± 2.7; Exp pre = 22.1 ± 2.9, post = 33.6 ±

92.6 ± 5.4, post = 106.6 ± 8.4), which were also elevated when these values were 
normalized for adenosine triphosphate using molar ratios. Circulatory uptake of 
Cr was significantly different between the groups, with blood concentrations 
(mg·dL-1) for the Con group peaking at 2 hours post-ingestion (25.99 ± 2.96), 
whereas the concentrations for the Exp group were lower and were still rising at 
5 hours (4.05 ± 0.87). The integrated area under the curve for the 5-hour 
postingestion period was 7-fold greater for the Con group. Although total Cr 
ingested over the 5 days supplementation period was less for the Cr PEG group, 
skeletal muscle uptake of Cr PEG was similar to Cr H2O. Based on circulating Cr 
concentrations, it seems that Cr PEG is cleared more slowly from the 
gastrointestinal tract. Thus, lower dosages of Cr may be ingested while 
maintaining optimal loading kinetics.

The primary purpose was to determine the separate and combined effects of 
creatine and caffeine supplementation during resistance training on body 
composition and muscle performance in trained young adults. Twenty-eight 
participants were randomized to supplement with creatine and caffeine (CR-CAF; 
n = 9, 22 ± 4 years; 0.1 g·kg-1·d-1 of creatine monohydrate + 3 mg·kg-1·d-1 of 
caffeine anhydrous micronized powder); creatine (CR; n = 7, 22 ± 4 years, 
0.1 g·kg-1·d-1 of creatine + 3 mg·kg-1·d-1 of micronized cellulose), caffeine 
(CAF; n = 6, 19 ± 1 years, 3 mg·kg-1·d-1 of caffeine + 0.1 g·kg-1·d-1 of 
maltodextrin) or placebo (PLA; n = 6, 23 ± 7 years, 0.1 g·kg-1·d-1 of 
maltodextrin + 3 mg·kg-1·d-1 micronized cellulose) one hour prior to performing 
resistance training for 6 weeks. Before and after training and supplementation, 
fat-free and fat mass (air-displacement plethysmography), muscle thickness 
(elbow and knee flexors and extensors; ultrasound), muscle strength 
(1-repetition maximum [1-RM] for the leg press and chest press), and endurance 
(one set of repetitions to volitional fatigue using 50% baseline 1-RM for leg 
press and chest press) were assessed. There was a group x time interaction 
(p = 0.049) for knee extensor muscle thickness with CR experiencing an increase 
over time with no changes in the other groups. There were no other between group 
differences for any variable. In conclusion, creatine supplementation and 
resistance training results in a small improvement in knee extensor muscle 
accretion in trained young adults.

INTRODUCTION: Resistance exercise training (RET) induces muscle hypertrophy 
that, when combined with co-temporal protein ingestion, is enhanced. However, 
fewer studies have been conducted when RET is combined with multi-ingredient 
supplements.
PURPOSE: We aimed to determine the effect of a high-quality multi-ingredient 
nutritional supplement (SUPP) versus an isonitrogenous (lower protein quality), 
isoenergetic placebo (PL) on RET-induced gains in lean body mass (LBM), muscle 
thickness, and muscle cross-sectional area (CSA). We hypothesized that 
RET-induced gains in LBM and muscle CSA would be greater in SUPP versus PL.
METHODS: In a double-blind randomized controlled trial, 26 (13 male, 13 female) 
healthy young adults (mean ± SD, 22 ± 2 yr) were randomized to either the SUPP 
group (n = 13; 20 g whey protein, 2 g leucine, 2.5 g creatine monohydrate, 300 
mg calcium citrate, 1000 IU vitamin D) or the PL group (n = 13; 20 g collagen 
peptides, 1.4 g alanine, 0.6 g glycine) groups, ingesting their respective 
supplements twice daily. Measurements were obtained before and after a 10-wk 
linear progressive RET program.
RESULTS: Greater increases in LBM were observed for SUPP versus PL (SUPP: +4.1 ± 
1.3 kg, PL: +2.8 ± 1.7 kg, P < 0.05). No additive effect of the supplement could 
be detected on vastus lateralis muscle CSA, but SUPP did result in increased 
biceps brachii muscle CSA and thickness (P < 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that when combined with RET, the consumption of SUPP 
increased LBM and upper-body CSA and thickness to a greater extent than to that 
observed in the PL group of healthy young adults.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) are associated 
with negative health outcomes, yet their associations with performance-enhancing 
substance (PES) use are unclear. This study aimed to determine whether ACEs 
predict greater use of legal and illegal PES in young adults.
METHODS: We analyzed data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to 
Adult Health (n = 14,322), Waves I (1994-1995) and III (2001-2002). ACEs 
included childhood sexual abuse, physical abuse, two neglect indicators, and 
cumulative ACEs. Legal (e.g. creatine monohydrate) and illegal (e.g. 
non-prescription anabolic-androgenic steroids; AAS) PES use was assessed.
RESULTS: Sexual abuse had the greatest effect and predicted higher odds of legal 
PES use (men: adjusted odds ratio [AOR] 1.66, 95% confidence interval [CI] 
1.06-2.59; women: AOR 3.74, 95% CI 1.63-8.59) and AAS use (men: AOR 8.89, 95% CI 
5.37-14.72; women: AOR 5.73, 95% CI 2.31-14.18). Among men, a history of 
physical abuse (AOR 3.04, 95% CI 2.05-4.52), being left alone by a 
parent/guardian (AOR 2.33, 95% CI 1.50-3.60), and basic needs not being met (AOR 
3.47, 95% CI 2.30-5.23) predicted higher odds of AAS use. Among women, basic 
needs not being met (AOR 2.94, 95% CI 1.43-6.04) predicted higher odds of AAS 
use. Among both men and women, greater number of cumulative ACEs predicted 
higher odds of both legal and illegal PES use.
CONCLUSIONS: ACEs predict greater PES use among young adults. Clinicians should 
monitor for PES use among those who have experienced ACEs and provide 
psychoeducation on the adverse effects associated with PES use.

Hackett, DA. Training, supplementation, and pharmacological practices of 
competitive male bodybuilders across training phases. J Strength Cond Res 36(4): 
963-970, 2022-Bodybuilding involves the pursuit of muscularity and leanness 
primarily through the use of progressive resistance training in combination with 
other practices such as manipulation of diet and use of ergogenic aids. This 
study aimed to compare the training practices and ergogenic aids used by 
competitive male bodybuilders across training phases. An online survey was 
completed by 235 competitive male bodybuilders with a median age of 26.0 
(interquartile range 23.0-31.3) years. Results showed that most respondents 
performed split-routines (85.5%), 4-7 sessions per week (95.7%), trained major 
muscle groups twice a week (>50%), and session duration being 60-90 minutes 
(55.7%). Off-season resistance training sessions mostly comprised of targeting 
2-3 muscle groups (56%), 2-3 exercises per muscle group (60.4%), 3-4 sets per 
exercise (73.2%), 7-12 repetition maximum (RM) per set (71.6%), and 61-180 
seconds recovery between sets and exercises (80.5%). At the precompetition phase 
(6 weeks before competition), there was a decrease in the number of muscle 
groups trained per session (p = 0.027) and a greater number of repetitions 
performed per set (p < 0.001). A significant increase in the reported aerobic 
exercise volume was found during precompetition (<0.001). Performance enhancing 
drugs were used by 53.6% of respondents who did not compete in natural 
bodybuilding competitions. Dietary supplements were used by 95.7% of respondents 
with the most common being creatine monohydrate (80.4%) and whey protein 
(65.8%). Findings suggest that competitive bodybuilders follow resistance 
training practices consistent with the broad muscular hypertrophy 
recommendations but a notable shift in practices occur in the weeks before 
competition.

Supplementing with creatine is very popular amongst athletes and exercising 
individuals for improving muscle mass, performance and recovery. Accumulating 
evidence also suggests that creatine supplementation produces a variety of 
beneficial effects in older and patient populations. Furthermore, evidence-based 
research shows that creatine supplementation is relatively well tolerated, 
especially at recommended dosages (i.e. 3-5 g/day or 0.1 g/kg of body mass/day). 
Although there are over 500 peer-refereed publications involving creatine 
supplementation, it is somewhat surprising that questions regarding the efficacy 
and safety of creatine still remain. These include, but are not limited to: 1. 
Does creatine lead to water retention? 2. Is creatine an anabolic steroid? 3. 
Does creatine cause kidney damage/renal dysfunction? 4. Does creatine cause hair 
loss / baldness? 5. Does creatine lead to dehydration and muscle cramping? 6. Is 
creatine harmful for children and adolescents? 7. Does creatine increase fat 
mass? 8. Is a creatine 'loading-phase' required? 9. Is creatine beneficial for 
older adults? 10. Is creatine only useful for resistance / power type 
activities? 11. Is creatine only effective for males? 12. Are other forms of 
creatine similar or superior to monohydrate and is creatine stable in 
solutions/beverages? To answer these questions, an internationally renowned team 
of research experts was formed to perform an evidence-based scientific 
evaluation of the literature regarding creatine supplementation.

OBJECTIVE: To analyse the information on health claims present in the labelling 
of creatine monohydrate (CM) products.
DESIGN: A descriptive study of a selection of products marketed as CM, with 
health claims, and that met the inclusion/exclusion criteria, was conducted 
using the Amazon and Google Shopping websites. The adequacy and compliance of 
the health claims were evaluated with the European legislative requirements 
(European Food Safety Authority and European Commission). The results were 
discussed with scientific evidence criteria from the Academy of Nutrition and 
Dietetics, International Olympic Committee, and International Society of Sports 
Nutrition, as well as the systematic review carried out by Mielgo-Ayuso in 2019.
SETTING: Health claims in the commercial communications of a sample of CM 
supplements, in relation to current legislation and scientific knowledge.
PARTICIPANT: A total of 554 CM products were obtained.
RESULTS: Of the total sample, only 167 met the inclusion/exclusion criteria. Of 
these, 30·5 % recommended a CM dose of 5·0-5·9 g/d, while 29·9 % recommended 3·0 
to 3·9 g/d. As for the health claims, 'Enhances physical performance' appeared 
in 73·1 % of the supplements, in most cases referring to a dosage of 3·0 to 3·9 
g/d for these products. The rest of the declarations were not adequate or needed 
to be modified.
CONCLUSION: Only 25 % of the health claims complied with the criteria 
established by the scientific reference documents. Most of the declarations must 
be modified or eliminated, as they could be considered fraudulent and/or 
misleading for the consumer.

The aim of the study was to verify the effects of creatine (Cr) supplementation 
on functional capacity (walking capacity; primary outcome) and calf muscle 
oxygen saturation (StO2) (secondary outcome) in symptomatic peripheral arterial 
disease (PAD) patients. Twenty-nine patients, of both sexes, were randomized 
(1:1) in a double-blind manner for administration of placebo (PLA, n = 15) or 
creatine monohydrate (Cr, n = 14). The supplementation protocol consisted of 20 
g/day for 1 week divided into four equal doses (loading phase), followed by 
single daily doses of 5 g in the subsequent 7 weeks (maintenance phase). 
Functional capacity (total walking distance) was assessed by the 6 min walk 
test, and calf muscle StO2 was assessed through near infrared spectroscopy. The 
measurements were collected before and after loading and after the maintenance 
phase. The level of significance was p < 0.05. No significant differences were 
found for function capacity (total walking distance (PLA: pre 389 ± 123 m vs. 
post loading 413 ± 131 m vs. post maintenance 382 ± 99 m; Cr: pre 373 ± 149 m 
vs. post loading 390 ± 115 m vs. post maintenance 369 ± 115 m, p = 0.170) and 
the calf muscle StO2 parameters (p > 0.05). Short- and long-term Cr 
supplementation does not influence functional capacity and calf muscle StO2 
parameters in patients with symptomatic PAD.

Creatine availability in adipose tissue has been shown to have profound effects 
on thermogenesis and energy balance in mice. However, whether dietary creatine 
supplementation affects brown adipose tissue (BAT) activation in humans is 
unclear. In the present study, we report the results of a double-blind, 
randomized, placebo-controlled, cross-over trial (NCT04086381) in which 14 
young, healthy, vegetarian adults, who are characterized by low creatine levels, 
received 20 g of creatine monohydrate per day or placebo. Participants were 
eligible if they met the following criteria: male or female, white, aged 18-30 
years, consuming a vegetarian diet (≥6 months) and body mass index 20-25 kg m-2. 
BAT activation after acute cold exposure was determined by calculating standard 
uptake values (SUVs) acquired by [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission 
tomography-magnetic resonance imaging. BAT volume (-31.32 (19.32) SUV (95% 
confidence interval (CI) -73.06, 10.42; P = 0.129)), SUVmean (-0.34 (0.29) SUV 
(95% CI -0.97, 0.28; P = 0.254)) and SUVmax (-2.49 (2.64) SUV (95% CI -8.20, 
3.21; P = 0.362)) following acute cold exposure were similar between placebo and 
creatine supplementation. No side effects of creatine supplementation were 
reported; one participant experienced bowel complaints during placebo, which 
resolved without intervention. Our data show that creatine monohydrate 
supplementation in young, healthy, lean, vegetarian adults does not enhance BAT 
activation after acute cold exposure.

Post-exercise recovery is a broad term that refers to the restoration of 
training capacity. After training or competition, there is fatigue accumulation 
and a reduction in sports performance. In the hours and days following training, 
the body recovers and performance is expected to return to normal or improve. 
ScienceDirect, PubMed/MEDLINE, and Google Scholar databases were reviewed to 
identify studies and position declarations examining the relationship between 
nutrition and sports recovery. As an evidence-based framework, a 4R's approach 
to optimizing post-exercise recovery was identified: (i) Rehydration-a 
fundamental process that will depend on the athlete, environment and sports 
event; (ii) Refuel-the consumption of carbohydrates is not only important to 
replenish the glycogen reserves but also to contribute to the energy 
requirements for the immune system and tissue reparation. Several bioengineered 
carbohydrates were discussed but further research is needed; (iii) 
Repair-post-exercise ingestion of high-quality protein and creatine monohydrate 
benefit the tissue growth and repair; and (iv) Rest-pre-sleep nutrition has a 
restorative effect that facilitates the recovery of the musculoskeletal, 
endocrine, immune, and nervous systems. Nutritional consultancy based on the 
4R's is important for the wise stewardship of the hydration, feeding, and 
supplementation strategies to achieve a timely recovery.

PURPOSE: the aim of the present study was to analyse the pattern of dietary 
supplements (DS) consumption on federated rugby players, including the analysis 
of differences based on the sex and competitive level (professional vs. 
amateurs).
MATERIAL AND METHODS: 144 rugby players (83 male and 61 female), of whom 69 were 
professionals and 75 amateurs, were recruited for the study. All the 
participants filled out a specific questionnaire about DS consumption including 
questions related to the consumption of DS and their effects on sport 
performance and health status.
RESULTS: 65.3% of participants declared consuming at least one DS, with a higher 
prevalence in males than females (77.1% vs. 49.2%) and in professionals thanin 
amateur players (79.7% vs. 52.0%). The main reason for consumption was to 
enhance sport performance (62.3%) with differences only based on sex (74.3% 
males vs. 43.2% females). The most common purchase sites were the Internet 
(45.6%) and specialised stores (39.8%). As to the moment of ingestion, 
professionals did this most frequently during competition and training (56.4% 
vs. 28.2%), whereas amateur players did so only during competition (20.5% vs. 
3.6%). Moreover, professional player intake most frequently in post-exercise 
(65.5% vs. 35.9%), whereas amateur during pre-exercise (30.8% vs. 5.5%). The DS 
most consumed included whey protein (44%), caffeine (42%), sports drinks (38%), 
energy bars (34%) and creatine monohydrate (31%), with a higher prevalence in 
male and professional players of whey protein and creatine monohydrate.
CONCLUSIONS: The main reason for DS consumption is for enhancing sports 
performance). Professional players more frequently purchase them on the Internet 
and consume DS during training and competition period and in the post-exercise, 
whereas amateur players consume during competition and pre-exercise. Related to 
the main form of DS consumption, it is observed that a moderate consumption of 
DS could be considered ergogenic, such as whey protein, sport bar and creatine, 
while an absence of other DS could be considered ergogenic.

X-linked creatine transporter deficiency is caused by the deficiency of the 
creatine transporter encoded by the SLC6A8 gene on Xq28. We here report a 
3-year-old boy with global developmental delay, autism and epilepsy. He had a 
normal MRI of the brain. Brain magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) 
subsequently showed an abnormally small creatine peak. His high urine 
creatine/creatinine ratio further suggested the diagnosis, later confirmed by 
hemizygous mutation detected in the SLC6A8 gene. His mother was also 
heterozygous for the same mutation. Supplementation with creatine monohydrate, 
arginine, and glycine (precursors of creatine) and supportive therapies, 
resulted in modest clinical improvement after 12 months. This case highlights 
the importance of doing MRS for boys with global delay/intellectual disability, 
autism and epilepsy even with a normal MRI of the brain, to pick up a 
potentially treatable cause.

Professional rugby league (RL) football is a contact sport involving repeated 
collisions and high-intensity efforts; both training and competition involve 
high energy expenditure. The present review summarizes and critiques the 
available literature relating the physiological demands of RL to nutritional 
requirements and considers potential ergogenic supplements that could improve 
players' physical capacity, health, and recovery during the preparatory and 
competition phases of a season. Although there may not be enough data to provide 
RL-specific recommendations, the available data suggest that players may require 
approximately 6-8 g·kg-1·day-1 carbohydrate, 1.6-2.6 g·kg-1·day-1 protein, and 
0.7-2.2 g·kg-1·day-1 fat, provided that the latter also falls within 20-35% of 
total energy intake. Competition nutrition should maximize glycogen availability 
by consuming 1-4 g/kg carbohydrate (∼80-320 g) plus 0.25 g/kg (∼20-30 g) 
protein, 1-4 hr preexercise for 80-120 kg players. Carbohydrate intakes of 
approximately 80-180 g (1.0-1.5 g/kg) plus 20-67 g protein (0.25-0.55 g/kg) 
0-2 hr postexercise will optimize glycogen resynthesis and muscle protein 
synthesis. Supplements that potentially improve performance, recovery, and 
adaptation include low to moderate dosages of caffeine (3-6 mg/kg) and ∼300 mg 
polyphenols consumed ∼1 hr preexercise, creatine monohydrate "loading" 
(0.3 g·kg-1·day-1) and/or maintenance (3-5 g/day), and beta-alanine 
(65-80 mg·kg-1·day-1). Future research should quantify energy expenditures in 
young, professional male RL players before constructing recommendations.

BACKGROUND: Legal performance-enhancing substances (PES), such as creatine, are 
commonly used by adolescents and young adults. As PES are mostly unregulated by 
the US Food and Drug Administration, there has been limited empirical attention 
devoted to examining their long-term safety and health outcomes. Preliminary 
studies have demonstrated associations between PES use and severe medical 
events, including hospitalizations and death. PES could be linked to 
cardiovascular disease (CVD), the most common cause of mortality in the US, by 
altering the myocardium, vasculature, or metabolism. The objective of this study 
was to examine prospective associations between the use of legal PES in young 
adulthood and CVD risk factors at seven-year follow-up.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Nationally representative longitudinal cohort data from 
the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health, Waves III 
(2001-2002) and IV (2008), were analyzed. Regression models determined the 
prospective association between the use of legal PES (e.g. creatine monohydrate) 
and CVD risk factors (e.g. body mass index, diabetes, hypertension, 
hyperlipidemia), adjusting for relevant covariates.
RESULTS: Among the diverse sample of 11,996 male and female participants, no 
significant differences by PES use in body mass index, diabetes, hypertension, 
or hyperlipidemia were noted at Wave III. In unadjusted comparisons, legal PES 
users (versus non-users) were more likely to be White, be male, be college 
educated, drink alcohol, and engage in weightlifting, exercise, individual 
sports, team sports, and other strength training. There were no significant 
prospective associations between legal PES use at Wave III and body mass index, 
hemoglobin A1c, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, and cholesterol (total, 
HDL, LDL, triglycerides) deciles at seven-year follow-up (Wave IV), adjusting 
for demographics, health behaviors, and Wave III CVD risk factors. Similarly, 
there were no significant prospective associations between legal PES use and 
diabetes, hypertension, or hyperlipidemia based on objective measures or 
self-reported medications and diagnoses, adjusting for demographics, health 
behaviors, and Wave III CVD risk.
CONCLUSIONS: We do not find evidence for a prospective association between legal 
PES use and CVD risk factors in young adults over seven years of follow-up, 
including BMI, diabetes, hypertension, or hyperlipidemia. It should be noted 
that legal PES use was operationalized dichotomously and as one broad category, 
which did not account for frequency, amount, or duration of use. Given the lack 
of regulation and clinical trials data, observational studies can provide much 
needed data to inform the safety and long-term health associations of legal PES 
use and, in turn, inform clinical guidance and policy.

INTRODUCTION: Aminoglycosides are widely known for their ototoxic side effects. 
Nevertheless, they are potent antibiotics used in the treatment of 
life-threatening conditions because of the current concern for antibiotic 
resistance. We hypothesized that creatine supplements which are believed to 
improve mitochondrial antioxidant defense system and maintain optimal energy 
homeostasis may improve the ototoxic side effects.
OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to investigate the protective effects of creatine 
monohydrate against ototoxicity induced by amikacin in rats in an experimental 
animal model, using distortion product otoacoustic emissions and auditory 
brainstem response.
METHODS: Twenty healthy rats were assigned to four groups (5 rats in each): the 
control group, the creatine monohydrate group, the amikacin group and the 
amikacin+creatine monohydrate group. The creatine monohydrate group received 
creatine at a dose of 2g/kg once daily via gastric gavage for 21 days. The 
amikacin group received amikacin at a dose of 600mg/kg by intramuscular 
injections once daily for 21 days. The amikacin+creatine monohydrate group 
received intramuscular injections of amikacin (600mg/kg) once daily for 21 days 
and creatine monohydrate (2g/kg) once daily via gastric gavage for 21 days. The 
control group received nothing. The distortion product otoacoustic emissions and 
auditory brainstem response measurements were performed on all rats on days 0, 
7, 21.
RESULTS: Regarding auditory brainstem response values, a significant increase in 
the auditory threshold was observed in the amikacin group on day 21 (p< 0.001). 
The amikacin+creatine monohydrate group showed significantly lower levels of 
auditory brainstem response auditory thresholds on day 21 in comparison to the 
amikacin group (p< 0.001). Additionally, the control group and the 
amikacin+creatine monohydrate group did not differ significantly with respect to 
auditory brainstem response thresholds on treatment day 21 (p> 0.05). When we 
compare distortion product otoacoustic emissions values, there was no 
significant difference between the amikacin and amikacin+creatine monohydrate 
groups on day 7 (p> 0.05), However significantly greater distortion product 
otoacoustic emissions values were observed in the amikacin+creatine monohydrate 
group on day 21 compared to the amikacin group (p< 0.001).
CONCLUSION: Our findings demonstrate that creatine treatment protects against 
amikacin ototoxicity when given at a sufficient dose and for an adequate time 
period.

PURPOSE: This review provides an overview of the current knowledge of the 
nutritional strategies to treat the signs and symptoms related to EIMD. These 
strategies have been organized into the following sections based upon the 
quality and quantity of the scientific support available: (1) interventions with 
a good level of evidence; (2) interventions with some evidence and require more 
research; and (3) potential nutritional interventions with little to-no-evidence 
to support efficacy.
METHOD: Pubmed, EMBASE, Scopus and Web of Science were used. The search terms 
'EIMD' and 'exercise-induced muscle damage' were individually concatenated with 
'supplementation', 'athletes', 'recovery', 'adaptation', 'nutritional 
strategies', hormesis'.
RESULT: Supplementation with tart cherries, beetroot, pomegranate, creatine 
monohydrate and vitamin D appear to provide a prophylactic effect in reducing 
EIMD. β-hydroxy β-methylbutyrate, and the ingestion of protein, BCAA and milk 
could represent promising strategies to manage EIMD. Other nutritional 
interventions were identified but offered limited effect in the treatment of 
EIMD; however, inconsistencies in the dose and frequency of interventions might 
account for the lack of consensus regarding their efficacy.
CONCLUSION: There are clearly varying levels of evidence and practitioners 
should be mindful to refer to this evidence-base when prescribing to clients and 
athletes. One concern is the potential for these interventions to interfere with 
the exercise-recovery-adaptation continuum. Whilst there is no evidence that 
these interventions will blunt adaptation, it seems pragmatic to use a 
periodised approach to administering these strategies until data are in place to 
provide and evidence base on any interference effect on adaptation.

BACKGROUND: Creatine represents a natural supplement and ergogenic aid for sport 
performance, but there are several concerns regarding its safety for health. The 
present double-blind placebo-controlled study evaluated the effect of creatine 
monohydrate supplementation on a panel of blood and urine health indicators in 
resistance training practitioners.
METHODS: Eighteen males performing resistance training three times per week were 
supplemented with 0.3 g/kg per day creatine monohydrate for 7 days and compared 
with matched controls supplemented with dextrosol. Blood and urine samples were 
collected pre- and 30 days post-supplementation to evaluate 41 biochemical 
parameters and renal function.
RESULTS: Creatine monohydrate supplementation did not cause adverse events and, 
as expected, promoted an increase of the performance and body weight. No 
modification of red blood cells parameters, white blood cells profile, blood 
lipid profile, metabolic and urine markers, hepatic and renal function were 
observed in the supplemented group.
CONCLUSIONS: Despite the expected weight increase, the creatine monohydrate 
supplementation is safe for health and no detrimental effects on different 
organs and physiological systems were observed in our cohort of volunteers.

Creatine Monohydrate (CrM) is a dietary supplement routinely used as an 
ergogenic aid for sport and training, and as a potential therapeutic aid to 
augment different disease processes. Despite its increased use in recent years, 
studies reporting potential adverse outcomes of CrM have been mostly derived 
from male or mixed sex populations. A systematic search was conducted, which 
included female participants on CrM, where adverse outcomes were reported, with 
meta-analysis performed where appropriate. Six hundred and fifty-six studies 
were identified where creatine supplementation was the primary intervention; 
fifty-eight were female only studies (9%). Twenty-nine studies monitored for 
adverse outcomes, with 951 participants. There were no deaths or serious adverse 
outcomes reported. There were no significant differences in total adverse 
events, (risk ratio (RR) 1.24 (95% CI 0.51, 2.98)), gastrointestinal events, (RR 
1.09 (95% CI 0.53, 2.24)), or weight gain, (mean difference (MD) 1.24 kg 
pre-intervention, (95% CI -0.34, 2.82)) to 1.37 kg post-intervention (95% CI 
-0.50, 3.23)), in CrM supplemented females, when stratified by dosing regimen 
and subject to meta-analysis. No statistically significant difference was 
reported in measures of renal or hepatic function. In conclusion, mortality and 
serious adverse events are not associated with CrM supplementation in females. 
Nor does the use of creatine supplementation increase the risk of total adverse 
outcomes, weight gain or renal and hepatic complications in females. However, 
all future studies of creatine supplementation in females should consider 
surveillance and comprehensive reporting of adverse outcomes to better inform 
participants and health professionals involved in future trials.

BACKGROUND: Muscular damage sustained while playing rugby may hinder performance 
across a season. β-Hydroxy β-Methylbutyrate (HMB) may help attenuate muscle 
damage and maintain lean mass and performance. This study sought to determine 
the effect of combining HMB with creatine monohydrate supplementation on 
measures of stress and muscle damage, body composition, strength and sprinting 
kinetics throughout a rugby season.
METHODS: This double-blind, cross-over investigation recruited 16 male 
collegiate rugby players to provide resting blood samples and complete 
assessments of body composition, strength and sprinting performance prior to 
their fall season (PREFALL). After testing, the athletes were matched for 
fat-free mass and assigned to consume one of two supplementation regimens for 
6 weeks: 5 g HMB + 5 g creatine per day (HMB-Cr: 20.9 ± 1.1 years; 177 ± 2 cm; 
88.4 ± 4.9 kg) or 5 g creatine + 5 g placebo per day (Cr: 21.4 ± 2.1 years; 
179 ± 2 cm; 88.3 ± 4.9 kg). After 6 weeks (POSTFALL), PREFALL testing was 
repeated in 13 of the original 16 athletes before a 10-wk wash-out period. 
Athletes who returned for the spring season (n = 8) repeated all fall-season 
procedures and testing prior to (PRESPRING) and following (POSTSPRING) their 
6-wk spring season, except they were assigned to the opposite supplementation 
regimen.
RESULTS: Linear mixed models with repeated measures revealed group x time 
interactions (p <  0.05) for observed for several measures but did not 
consistently and positively favor one group. During the fall season, knee 
extensor peak torque was reduced by 40.7 ± 28.1 Nm (p = 0.035) for HMB-Cr but 
remained consistent for Cr, and no group differences or changes were noted in 
the spring. In the spring, greater knee flexor rate of torque development 
(~ 149 Nm·sec- 1, p = 0.003) and impulse (~ 4.5 Nm·sec, p = 0.022) were observed 
in Cr at PRESPRING but not at POSTSPRING. Although significant interactions were 
found for cortisol concentrations, vastus lateralis pennation angle, and 
sprinting force, post-hoc analysis only revealed differences between fall and 
spring seasons. No other differences were observed.
CONCLUSIONS: The combination of HMB and creatine monohydrate supplementation 
does not provide a greater ergogenic benefit compared to creatine monohydrate 
supplementation alone. Body composition, strength, and sprinting ability did not 
change across the season with creatine monohydrate supplementation.
