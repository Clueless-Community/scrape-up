## The goal ðŸŽ¯
While working on a project, we often ran into a situation where we faced issues like request timeout, rate limit, etc. But leveraging the power of web scrapping, we are here with a solution. This project is a web-scraping-based Python tool that you may use as an alternative to APIs to scrape data from a variety of sites, including GitHub, Twitter, Instagram, and any helpful website.
